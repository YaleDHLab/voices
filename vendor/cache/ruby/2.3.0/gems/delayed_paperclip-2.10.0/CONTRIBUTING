Contributor Policy
=================

Commit bit. If you have a commit accepted into the project then you get full git access to the repo. If I don't give you this in a timely manner just send me a message.

Testing
======

Please don't commit code without tests. You can bootstrap the development environment by running `bundle install`. After that, running `rake` should just work. If it doesn't then file a bug.

Versioning
=========

Don't bump the version in any changes you make or pull in to the project. I'll maintain rights to push the gem to rubygems.org and make releases when appropriate.

And please keep the README up to date. Thank you!

a        Serena Williams has an ambition and drive that is larger than life. This has helped her become the face of her sport, but she is consistently considered exceptional for a Black woman. The language used to describe her career goes like this: In 2001, Serena and Venus Williams were booed by fans at the Indian Wells match who accused them of fixing the match. These unfounded allegations were accompanied by horrific racist comments directed toward their family. Williams has been boycotting the event for the past 13 years. But this year she returned. And she won. Her victory at Indian Wells signifies not only her physical triumph but also her ability to overcome the many obstacles that she faces as a Black female athlete. Williams has a phenomenal skill set on the court, but what truly makes her “exceptional” is her ability to continue pursuing her dreams while dealing with racist, sexual, gendered, and character debilitating statements like these on a daily basis. The mental tenacity and emotional strength that this woman must have inspires me on a daily basis. It is easy for us to remind ourselves that our people have rights now, and the fact that the media cares enough about a Black female athlete means that we are on the road to re-wiring our social stratospheres to erase the hate that racism fuels within us. Like Williams, I am a Black female athlete. I am Yale’s current record holder in the indoor and outdoor Shot Put events, and I have more goals and higher expectations for myself than most people know about. When I break my record or score high in the Ivy League, people usually presume that I have reached my potential. I am discouraged from setting new goals and convinced to believe that my athletic achievements are solely based on my race. Like Williams, I am subject to ridiculous claims about Black athleticism stemming from biological advantages. Allegedly, we have a bone in our feet that helps us to run faster and jump higher. I really wish that this was true, but the only bone that I’ve noticed in my feet are the bunions that poke out on the insides of my feet, causing me to have to wear shoes that are two sizes too big for my natural foot length. Bunions are a very common trait for Black women in the United States to have, and yet Black female athletes are rarely praised for being some of the top athletes in the world despite having them. Rather than celebrating our feats by recognizing the mental toughness that it takes to put up with pain on a daily basis in order to reach a goal that may feel elusive for months or years at a time, we are reminded that our African heritage somehow helps. Like Williams, I am approached by reporters who do not respect my intelligence, expecting a cookie-cutter answer speaking to my humility and shock that I succeeded at something that I work for thirty or more hours per week. Whenever I break a school record, the random Yale Daily News reporter who is assigned to me thinks for a long and hard 30 seconds before asking, “Did you go into this weekend thinking you were going to break it?” I would really like to know how anyone is going to write a compelling story about me with these questions. “When you saw your distance, what was your first thought?” Well, that shit was fire. I want the reporter to know that the most important part of a competition throw is what happens during the throw itself. Understanding how I train my brain to think throughout my throw, to trigger each muscle in my body to work in synch is the most important part of throwing. Why, then, would I want to tell the reporter, “When I saw the shot land 48 feet away from me, my first thought was that nobody else in the field was going to throw farther than that.” Reporters do not like to report that kind of stuff. Reporters do not want athletes to be confident, and when we are, it is distorted as some kind of over zealous and cocky character trait. Media coverage portrays Serena Williams and other Black female athletes as being both too masculine and too sexual at the same time. Williams is often criticized for wearing makeup, keeping her hairdos fresh and her style on point because she is apparently trying to cover up her masculine features. Commentators frequently comment on her stature as though it is unfair, making it seem as though she is brutish in comparison with her opponents. But, because of her grunt, she is also too sexual when she plays. People remark that Williams probably has the best mating call and definitely has the best sex grunt. From personal experience, I can tell you that sex is the farthest thing from Williams’s mind when she is at high stakes in a competition and doing everything in her power to calculate and calibrate her next move on the court. My former coach used to watch my female teammates and I throw and remark that “women are amazing creatures.” On most days I felt like I may as well be on a stripping pole. Dealing with this sexualization was always a painful experience, and it took a lot of fortitude to get through practice on a daily basis. An example of Williams’s fortitude is her personal style when competing. She wears clothes that have been designed by herself and her team of designers, clothes that she feels comfortable in and that flatter her in the way that she desires. Williams is showing people that her body is not exceptional but rather the product of hard work, and that many women who take themselves seriously in the weight room will look like her and require a different style of clothing. When talking about Indian Wells, it is good to identify the racist actions, and also how the intersectionality of racism and sexism affect Williams. However, what is lacking in this conversation is the support that we owe Williams for her triumphs. Racism and sexism psychologically and emotionally impair people around the world to an extent that they cannot function in a social context. We should celebrate the mental toughness that Williams must have in order to press forward year after year being one of two Black women in her camp. Athletes are never given the clout that we deserve for the mental and emotional battles that we deal with when training to get to the next level, so we must realize that Williams’s accomplishments are more than athletic and that she has personal attributes that women in our society are convinced to hide. This woman has both a mental capacity and an emotional strength that are immeasurable, and her muscular beauty is a physical embodiment of these powerful character traits.  by Karléh Wilson         On Friday, February 27th, the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY) hosted a conversation with the esteemed professors Elizabeth Alexander and Erica James. This was the first in what BSAY is calling “the Black Professor Series,” a collections of conversations designed “to bring Black students and professors together in a personal environment.” A small group of undergraduates convened at the Afro-American Cultural center to engage in a casual discussion with the professors regarding their work and experiences as black professors. The forum was led by first year students Elizabeth Spenst (MC’18) and Alexis Williams (CC’18), and the students who were present chimed in with their own questions. Things started out formally with questions for both professors regarding their work outside of the classroom and what they aim to do in their respective non-academic spheres. Prof. James was first to answer, reflecting on her work with the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas. As founding Director and Chief Curator of the gallery, James was largely responsible for conceiving a vision for the museum and seeing to its successful completion. She cited her mission as follows, to “convey the contours of ‘the shadow’ of Africa,” within the art she chose to feature. This presented an interesting “tension,” according to James, between her individual vision and her responsibility to the collective cultural community of the Bahamas; a theme that both professors agreed constantly reoccurs in the realm of Black art. Prof. Alexander was next to speak, regarding her work as a poet, patron, and teacher. Her mission as an artist was clearly stated, to “try her best, whenever possible, to turn white money towards Black creativity.” It is this mission statement that led to her work with the Cave Canem Foundation, which she regards as “a space for Black poets to be free within ourselves.” The same mission statement shapes her syllabi and classroom experience. Prof. Alexander makes constructive use of her connections within the Black artistic community and Yale’s financial and academic resources – the Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscripts Library, for example – to ensure that the dialogue between Black artists, living and deceased, continues. Whether this happens in interview form or via interaction with an archive, it is a conversation that Prof. Alexander works determinedly to maintain. The conversation took a more light-hearted turn when student Alexandra Barlowe (BR’17) questioned the professors as to their hobbies and “unexpected interests.” Prof. Alexander responded first, cheerfully citing her work in poetry as her favorite hobby. She also listed dancing, great food, and mindless TV among her favorite things. Prof. James answered by describing her love of traveling, gardening and cooking. After a few more questions, the discussion came to a close with both professors offering the same piece of advice to all who were present. To quote Prof. James specifically, “it’s all in you…whatever you want to do, everything that it could possibly take lies within you. You just have to keep pushing.” by Julianna Simms         Claudia Rankine did not win the National Book Award. She told us so at her talk on Wednesday, March 4th, when someone asked her if she thought black artists were sufficiently recognized by elite literary circles. She laughed and raised her eyebrows, and mentioned that she had, however, won something at the NAACP Recognition Awards: “If they won’t reward us, we’ll give ourselves our own awards.” She wasn’t the only one in the room who thought she deserved to have won the National Book Award. LC 201 was full, and I know that by the end of her reading I was entirely convinced of Citizen’s merit, relevance, and beauty. Rankine is a poet who doesn’t think of herself as a prophet, rather, a storyteller. Rankine described Citizen as a “community book.” It presents anecdotes from her friends—people of color and otherwise—about race. In some cases she seeks to answer specific questions: “What was a situation in which you knew you were acting as a white body?” leading to a gorgeous lyric about the New York subway system. Other times, Rankine simply asked friends for stories about race, which produced equally powerful verse. Throughout the reading, Rankine’s tone was humble. Her narratives were simple and her delivery even simpler. She spoke of things that were tragic not because they were dramatic but because they were ordinary: the cashier who asked if she thought her credit card would work, the man who cut her friend in line, the therapist who chased a black patient off her lawn. Rankine makes lyrical what is commonplace, and elevates to tragedy the apparently small cruelties committed towards non-white citizen. And in doing so, she creates her own dramatic tradition. The novelty of Rankine’s verse did not go unappreciated; she recounted stories of dozens of readers who came to her, crying, to thank her while thanking her for writing the book. She had represented the everyday of their lives, the quotidian injustices they kept silent because no one told them they were worthy of discussion. I cried too; like so many others, I had never read a text with which I identified so strongly. We all wanted to tell her, “You are my voice.” That said, I was wary of the perception of Citizen as a universal text. Yes, it vocalizes the experiences of many, but at the end it is still one person’s narrative. I read a review of Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie that said, “Ngozi Adichie is to blackness what Philip Roth is to Jewishness.” Or, better, Ngozi Adichie is to blackness what Philip Roth is to Jewishness and Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman and Shakespeare are to whiteness. These authors are not all the same; there is not one whiteness, nor is there one blackness, nor is there one person-of-colorness. Our voices are many; more than one must be heard. by Coryna Ogunseitan         “The impossible is the least that one can demand.” – James Baldwin I have never felt more intellectually and spiritually affirmed than I have at the Asian American Studies Conference last month – an unprecedented event in Yale history. Over the course of the conference, I had the pleasure of listening to academics and graduate students delve into the aesthetics and politics of Asian American film and sonic production, the extraction of blood from indigenous Hawaiians as an extension of militaristic settler colonialism in the Pacific, Spam as a site of critical analysis (something crucial to my childhood), and the queer racial formations implied in the literary usage of washing socks as a metaphor for anal fisting – an outstanding array of research projects that demonstrated the depth of Asian American Studies as a crucial and necessary academic discipline. For decades, members of the Asian American Studies Task Force have worked to translate our vision of a truly representative education into reality. Through the conference, we were able to successfully create conversations that actively combated the generative fable of whiteness – which operates on the consumption and reproduction of dominant narratives that only serve to erase students of color. It is easy to feel hopeless and exhausted in places that understand you as less than the entirety of your humanity, your history, your potential, your significance as a person who has and continues to survive even when you have been marked as a target of violence on the basis of existing. To use a quote from a presentation I heard on the intersections between #blacklivesmatter and Asian American female visuality, have we ever had bodies other than the ones you constructed?” The University has acknowledged demands from student activists for an Asian American Studies program at Yale since the 70s, but to the most limited, tokenizing extent with the renewed availability of a single survey course on Asian American history. President Salovey himself gave a speech at the reception that culminated with oh-my-how-far-we’ve-come musings on the supposed strength and notability of Yale’s (have I mentioned – nonexistent?) Asian American Studies program – an underwhelming experience for several present. From this it was made apparent that although there has been only one Asian American Studies course regularly offered at Yale – taught by the only professor in all of Yale faculty who specializes in Asian American Studies, it is in Salovey’s opinion that this meager display is demonstrative of quote-end-quote fulfilled promises. Vijay Iyer – jazz pianist, Yale alum, and a panelist at the conference – describes this phenomenon aptly in his presentation on ‘performing while brown in 2015,’ remarking that “the trope of the only brown person in the room is the presence that neutralizes white guilt by signaling at diversity while exhibiting zero allegiance to or investment in social justice.” To address the trauma inherent in having to fight for access to your own stories would be to concede to something terribly wrong with Yale’s claim to being wholly representative in its breadth of available programs of study. If Yale is truly committed to a liberal arts education through which students can “think and learn across disciplines, literally liberating or freeing the mind to its fullest potential” as they so emphatically declare on their admissions website, then it’s past time that Oceanic and Asian American students are granted the opportunity to explore what we are rightfully entitled to: the legacies of resistance, community, and artistic creation that we have generated as folks whose pain has been and continues to be systematically made invisible by the United States – despite ongoing issues of exploitation, criminal neglect, sexual violence, and militaristic imperialism. To every student who has had to bear distorted or absent representations of themselves in educational spaces: it has become increasingly evident to me that our collective process of self-determination cannot be complete without being able to access and understand one’s inheritance. For me, that would entail the struggle and the beauty that is being an Asian woman navigating, transcending, and challenging a white man’s world in a plethora of ways – such can be critically explored through the sheer richness, complexity, and enduring legacy of Asian and Pacific American presence. Inheritance is beyond recognition: it is the means by which we gain access to a heritage of challenging subjugation, to a past laden with contradictions. It is also how we begin to understand a future of accountability, for it is precisely in these spaces that uphold marginalized narratives as worthy of discussion, thought, time, and inquiry that we can also identify the ways in which our successes have been made possible by dehumanizing others. Alongside fragmented histories of struggling for justice in opposition to war, exclusion, and occupation; artistic and literary achievements; distinct cultures forged from our sociopolitical and economic positioning in the US today – our complicity in preserving white supremacy is an element of our inheritance that we must acknowledge exists and continually fight. It is also for this reason that we must have Asian American Studies: it is not only an intellectually and emotionally validating field of study for many students of color, but it also provides an avenue through which folks can learn what it means to take up space at the expense of others, as well as how to build coalitions more inclusively. After all, Asian American Studies, African American Studies, Chicano Studies, and Native American Studies are intimately united with one another in their movements for integration into college curriculums – resisting white, cisgender, heteropatriarchal narratives of liberation and how they, as Iyer puts it, “enable whiteness to speak for us without listening to us.” Even though the conference has long come to a close, Asian and Oceanic peoples at Yale resisted those narratives and upheld our own – I am moved, humbled, and still interrogating the ways in which we can appreciate and continue to fight for our recognition in critical studies, while dismantling cultural legitimation of experience through academia, which excludes those who are most marginalized within our own communities and beyond. Above all, I am inspired by everyone on the Task Force who worked tirelessly to make it possible: it is a testament to the inimitable desire of students to break the oppressive logic of silence together. It was impossible to attend the conference and not feel overwhelmed by hope. I am confident that a day in the future will come when we finally win this fight for our inheritance. by Yuni Chang         July 1st, 2015 marks an event that many students of color at predominantly white institutions could imagine only in their wildest dreams: a black feminist scholar will become the president of Swarthmore College. Valerie Smith, who has served as Princeton University’s Dean of College for the past three years, was announced president-elect of the private liberal arts college this past February. Smith is an accomplished leader making history in more ways than one with her election. An interdisciplinary scholar of African American literature and culture, Smith brings an intersectional perspective to academe as a woman of color invested in mobilizing education for social change. While at Princeton, she founded the Center for African American Studies and led initiatives to diversify faculty members and the student body. At Princeton, Smith also chaired a committee that examined the academic and cultural experiences of low-income and first-generation students. Without a doubt, Smith is dedicated to using her high administrative positions at predominantly white institutions to transform elite college campuses into welcoming spaces for all students. For students from underrepresented backgrounds at prestigious colleges in particular, there are a variety of factors that can provoke sentiments of alienation. One of the most significant factors is the diversity of faculty and administration along the lines of race, ethnicity, and gender. Although the number of both students and faculty of color in predominantly white institutions has increased since the late 1960s, the highest administrative ranks are still overwhelmingly white and male. Yale’s Office of Institutional Research, for example, reveals that women make up only 39% of Yale University faculty while racial/ethnic minorities stand at 22.5%. The statistics are even more deplorable for women of color in the academy – black female faculty total at 0.012%, Latina faculty at 0.014%, Asian women at 0.07%, and Native American women at 0.0005%. Meanwhile, data from the American Council on Education indicates that only 13% of college presidents were from ethnic minority groups in 2011 and today, only 26% of college presidents are women. Minority female college presidents are at an embarrassingly lower rate. These figures demonstrate the dearth of women of color holding higher positions of power in our country’s most prestigious academic institutions. Smith’s list of accomplishments shows a commitment to real changes beyond diversity. In her welcome reception speech, Smith emphasized her belief in building a college environment in which all students, “regardless of socioeconomic circumstances,” may have the opportunity to thrive. Smith shows a keen awareness of the ways in which a vague conception of diversity is not enough and how the intersections of class with other aspects of our identities affect our experiences in the college. For students like Uriel Medina, Swarthmore College ’15, a college president who privileges inclusivity as well as diversity has become a source of hope. “Many student demonstrations in the spring of 2013 and subsequent events/publications clearly showed there are issues of inclusivity, and it’s a topic I encounter a lot with many people on campus  a feeling of not belonging here,” Medina, a Latino student, says. “That’s because the driving force behind ‘diversity’ doesn’t tend to go past numbers.” Medina also believes that a college president like Smith helps minority students feel more at home. “I’m really excited to have Dr. Smith as our next president because I think a lot of underrepresented students on campus can see themselves in her, as I do.” Her intersectional identity allows for minority students to identify with their campus’s leadership, while also highlighting the importance of university leaders who foster a sense of belonging among marginalized student communities. Moreover, as a feminist scholar, Smith challenges dominant conceptions of “legitimate” academic discipline that are often based on Eurocentricity and serve to further exclude students of color from less privileged backgrounds. “As a leader, [Valerie Smith] is constantly thinking of how to use our intellectual and creative powers as a group to build something together, something that both honors all of those who came before us and pushes us forward into new and colorful improvisational territory,” said Yale professor Daphne Brooks in 2009 during a speech of honor for Smith, who was at the time Director of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton. “Her ecumenically infused, spiritual sense of purpose has enabled her to understand and embrace a kind of scholarship that encourages productive critical conversations and a kind of teaching and mentoring and programming that cultivates community.” While women of color have already made large strides in diversifying the academy, we must demand more roles for leaders like Swarthmore president-elect Valerie Smith. In prioritizing inclusivity over diversity, Valerie Smith creates space for students, especially those for whom these white academic spaces were never meant to serve. by Ivonne Gonzalez  					Reblogged this on OCG. 					Reblogged this on badassafrofem and commented:        As a Black woman with curves – and proud of it, I might add – the world of high fashion invited me to marvel at its fabulous revelry from afar, but I was not invited to the party…until now. As of Friday, March 13th, the record-breaking pop star and longtime fashion icon Rihanna has been named the new face of Dior. This is the first time that the renowned French fashion house will feature a Black spokesperson. The implications of Dior’s decision are numerous. First, Rihanna’s unapologetic personality, versatile style and career path are a drastic departure from other longstanding Dior spokespeople such as Marion Cotillard and Kiera Knightly. By bringing on Rihanna, Dior is making a bold and unmistakably intentional deviation from the demure, ultra-femme mademoiselles that have characterized their brand for so long. To incorporate Rihanna is not to abandon femininity as a whole. Rihanna represents where femininity is going. On the street, her style is often androgynous, effortlessly mixing masculine pieces with traditionally feminine elements such as lingerie, lace or figure hugging separates, all the while maintaining her uniquely compelling sense of style, beauty and sensuality. It’s that “Good Girl Gone Bad” thing we know and love. Dior’s decision is encouraging. A door has been opened by Rihanna. A Black woman is not only occupying, but also representing a once exclusively Eurocentric space; a respected space within the industry whose opinion regarding what is “beautiful” is highly valued by many. There arises a question of agency and authorship, however. For one, Rihanna’s selection as spokesperson was an invitation; a carefully calculated and intentional invitation. Still, Black beauty is relying on European affirmation. We [Black people] remain reliant upon the dominant culture to accept us into its approved aesthetic. We should still celebrate the success of our sister, Rihanna, recognizing that it is one step in the right direction. For a few years, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, or CFDA, has supported a joint campaign documenting the diversity of models featured in fashion shows and promoting the inclusion of more women and men of color on the runway. Progress has been made and statistics for this past Fall/Winter 2015 Season are encouraging. However, there are rumors fluttering about the fashion sphere that model diversity is simply a “trend.” You know, a trend, like acid wash jeans or sneaker wedges, fervent and fleeting. Hopefully, Dior’s decision to appoint Rihanna as a spokesperson and representative of the brand will allow the impact of her image a wider-reaching impact and longevity. After all, a nameless, brown body featured on runway for all of 90 seconds is one thing, but to be a sponsor and ambassador for a major fashion house is something else entirely. by Julianna Simms  					Well said! Im wondering about other major fashion houses, though – have any of them featured black spokespeople in the past?        On March 31, Cherokee playwright Mary Kathryn Nagle, in collaboration with Yale Native students and faculty, will host a staged reading of Sliver of a Full Moon. The play documents the grassroots movement that led to the 2013 Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which included a new provision that allows tribes to prosecute non-Native offenders who commit certain assault crimes. The survivors who testified in front of Congress were interviewed for this play and their stories were transcribed as a part of the narrative. Dianne Millich (Southern Ute), Lisa Brunner (White Earth Ojibwe), and Billie Jo Rich (Eastern Band Cherokee) will reprise their roles to tell their stories once again, accompanied by a full cast of professional and undergraduate Native actors to tell this impactful story. This production will mark the two-year anniversary of the passage of the VAWA Reauthorization by bringing an underrepresented narrative to the stage. Sliver of a Full Moon explores how limits on Indian sovereignty have affected tribal nations for generations using the stories of a tribal police officer, a tribal judge, survivors of domestic violence, senators, and congressmen and women. Harnessing the voices of those affected by VAWA, the narrative issues a powerful dialogue about the political status of tribal nations and underscores the importance of sovereignty in eradicating violence against Native women. But Nagle’s piece is not a static entity: it was recently revised to better represent the exclusion of Alaska Native tribes within VAWA’s reauthorization. The play ultimately questions how we can restore full jurisdiction to tribal nations and ensure safety for all Native women. The play incorporates stories of survivors in order to deconstruct post-colonial rape culture in Indian Country. The upcoming performance is especially significant as it is the play’s debut on a college campus, and it aims to educate future leaders about the political status and livelihood of Native American communities. The Honorable William Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals will provide introductory remarks while Tulalip Tribes Vice-Chairwoman, Deborah Parker and Eastern Band Cherokee Indians Chairwoman, Terri Henry will speak at the end of the evening on VAWA’s impact and the work that still needs to be done. In the words of Lisa Brunner, the 2013 Reauthorization is “a sliver of a full moon of what’s needed to really protect us.” Sliver of a Full Moon is hosted by the Yale Native American Law Students Association, the Yale Group for the Study of Native America, and the Yale Native American Cultural Center. The performance is in the Levinson Auditorium of the Yale Law School at 6:30pm on March 31st. Doors open at 6pm. This event is free and open to the public. by Reed Bobroff         “Racism created race,” Coates said. His words echoed soundly in the SSS lecture hall, contributing to a wider discussion about race in America that continues to gain momentum on Yale’s campus and beyond. On Friday March 27th the Black Student Alliance at Yale, the Yale College Dean’s Office, the Office of the President, and the African American Studies Department hosted a discussion with Ta-Nehisi Coates, a national correspondent for The Atlantic who wrote the nationally-recognized article “The Case for Reparations.” The discussion pushed against American society’s ignorance and complacency over the fact that this country’s previous slave-based economy played an important role in making it a worldwide powerhouse. Coates argued that America’s economic success both internationally and domestically can trace its origins to the exploitation of Black people. The prosperity of institutions such as Yale owes its success to that old slave-based economy. Before delving into the economic roots of racial division in America, Coates began the discussion on a personable note by reminding his audience of the country’s racist past through his experiences growing up.  He noted something as simple as the clothing he used were possible threats to his safety: “About two-thirds of my brain was school work and one-third of my brain was concerned with the safety of my body.” Sadly, Coates’ words summarize a reality that many young Black people have to face every day walking home from school. These consequences, as Coates so argued, stem from a long history of economic coercion that Black Americans had to face since the country’s agrarian age. Throughout the discussion, Coates argued that resources denied to Black people even after emancipation by discriminatory laws have caused the racial divide in contemporary American society. Property, voting, and education were all basic rights and privileges that Black people were historically unable to obtain and remain limited in access to even to this day. Tracing back the economic roots of the racial divide we see today, Coates noted that “if you want to find the wealthiest area in the country in 1860, forget Boston, you go to Mississippi Valley”—a region that had the largest per capita income drawn mainly from cheap slave labor, and remains a region where much of the old wealth comes from the antebellum era. Still, slavery, according to Coates, was not the only factor that hindered Black people’s socioeconomic progress. The inability to gain valuable property pushed Black people to the side and limited their investment and employment in this country’s capitalist industry. At the end of the discussion, Coates recognized that societal questions should now focus on white American identity and whether or not that identity is tied to the old slaveholding society. The general opinion of Coates’ discussion was widely receptive. Sana Mojarradi ’18 stated that she enjoyed how “he [Coates] broke down housing discrimination” and how Coates developed certain issues that are not usually discussed from an economic perspective while also appreciating Coates bold statements on America’s self-imposed domestic terrorism. Sydney Young ’18 shared some of the same sentiments, noting that she “liked the way he [Coates] put everything into the perspective of the present and how people like to think about this ideal America to just turn off all the bad things.” Another audience member Birdy Assefa ’18 summed up the discussion by stating that “slavery is the road we took to become a great country” and that acknowledging this will help alleviate the racial divide that continues to plague the United States. by Oscar Garcia-Ruiz        The most recent occurrence of misconduct by the New Haven Police Department (NHPD) was at the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade. Following the parade, a police officer was videotaped slamming down Teandrea Cornelius, a 15-year-old Black girl, face first into the ground while she was already handcuffed. The video of this incident has gone viral, and the New Haven community is livid. Barbara Fair, a New Haven resident and activist, has been leading protests since the incident. The demands of the protest were for the officer who attacked Cornelius to be fired and punished for his actions. The protesters rallied on the steps of the Police Department at 1 Union Avenue and demanded that the Chief of the department come out and speak to us in front of the news cameras that were stationed there to document the demonstration. We got no answers. After being laughed at by the officers inside of the building, Barbara Fair led everyone outside to block traffic in efforts to get a more adequate response from the officers. People began losing direction and motivation, and what was initially a collective protest quickly became a collection of individuals who had no way to collectively target their anger and frustration. Eventually, a Lieutenant Officer approached the crowd and promised us that the investigation of the Officer who attacked Cornelius was underway. I felt myself locked in a crowd of negativity and helplessness. Surrounding me were people who wanted answers, people who wanted to believe in the idea of justice that was promised to them by the department. Standing in front of them was a man who had all of the answers, but they just weren’t enough. People got discouraged and started to go home. The Lieutenant Officer left and people began discussing a follow-up protest at City Hall the next day. It was agreed on that the protest would happen, but conflict about the organization and structure of the protest arose. One Black woman complained to Barbara Fair that the protest was horribly planned and that she could do a better job at organizing than her. They argued for a few minutes as I looked on, disappointed at how easily my people were falling apart. On my way home I saw two police officers of color, one Black man and one Latina woman. I asked them what they thought of the protest. “We love it when we see people exercising their rights and caring about what happens to the community!” the Black officer explained. The Latina woman nodded her head in agreement. “But you know, this isn’t good for people,” I said to them. “People here are angry and upset and confused. They are not getting any feedback from you guys. If the department worked effectively, we would all feel safe in the hands of the law, and communicating with police officers would not have to be done by protest.” The officers nodded their heads and looked apathetic. “You know, we just cannot meet your demands. There is a protocol in place for officers who are accused of committing police brutality. We can’t just take their jobs from them. Their jobs are protected under the law. It’s just like any other civilian with a job, you can’t just disallow someone from working when you don’t know that the accusations are true.” “What about the fear that a video like this will incite community members? Can’t you guys suspend the officer temporarily to at least save face? Wouldn’t it be better for everyone if they felt as though the NHPD was serving their own best interests?” The officers explained that the police officers have a right to their jobs, even if there are videos as disturbing as the one from the St. Patrick’s Day parade. When I admitted to them that I believe that they have too much power, I was met once again with apathy. On the Friday of that week there was a counter-protest organized by the New Haven Police Department supporting the officer who was filmed slamming down Cornelius. The same group who protested with Barbara Fair went to the counter-protest in order to counter their counter-protest. These protests are not productive because the protesters have demands that cannot be met by the NHPD. by Karléh Wilson        This past weekend, Jook Songs, Yale’s Asian American writing and performance group, put on an exquisite spring show called Tide. The pieces performed at Tide went beyond the conventions of poetry and actualized narratives and conversations on stage. The works were reminiscences about the lives of the writers and how they had been shaped by events therein. And while not everything said onstage may have been, strictly speaking, true, it was all incredibly sincere. The writers featured in Tide delivered stories both personal and fictional. Regardless of the narrative form, each writer constructed worlds in which the audience would have stories recreated for them. The performances in Tide were exactly that: a gentle ebb and flow of pieces. The ways that members of Jook Songs performed their pieces were subtle and precise. There was none of the typical vocal acrobatics and familiar gesticulating of Yale’s main slam scene; instead there was a polished serenity to each piece no matter how strange or serious the topic. Tide ended with a brief skit by the group’s senior members. They shared what being in Jook Songs had meant to them and what they hoped it could be for others. They were heartfelt in sharing what the safe space and community had been for them during the years they had been in the group, and how the group helped them feel validated in their identities. These complex feelings were shared with the audience at Tide in a way I’m sure I won’t forget. by Taylor Jackson         On Monday March 23rd, Little League World Series star Mo’Ne Davis was called a “slut” in a tweet sent out by Bloomsburg University first baseman Joey Casselberry. “Disney is making a movie about Mo’Ne Davis? WHAT A JOKE. That slut got rocked by Nevada.” The consequences of Casselberry’s comment came at him swiftly and mercilessly. In addition to social media backlash, his Twitter account was deactivated later in the week and Bloomsburg University ordered Casselberry’s removal from their baseball team. The university explained their decision stating that they were “deeply saddened” by Casselberry’s comments and ensuring that they “do not represent Bloomsburg University.” Davis and her coach Alex Rice – who was recently named “Citizen of the Year” by The Inquirer – responded to the scandal tactfully. The two contacted Bloomsburg University President David L. Soltz asking the school to reconsider Casselberry’s dismissal. Soltz commended Davis for her “maturity” in light of the situation, but stated that the university is “standing firm” in their decision. The sexualization of Black females is a theme so familiar it aches. It is a subtle and droning pain. Like some terrible song hopelessly stuck in my head. Numbing. This issue needs a dissertation, not a single article. Actually, it needs a running column in every publication forever. This is a living, breathing, and layered problem. If one good thing can come out of this incredible showing of ignorance, I hope it is the debunking of the myth that is a “post-Racial America” and encourages the country to examine its conscience and vocabulary. Regarding Casselberry’s tweet, I do not believe that his intended message was one of targeted racism or sexism. Rather, it appears he was simply trying to voice his disapproval of Mo’Ne’s recognition as an athlete. He believes her athletic prowess is undeserving of the recent praise it has received in the press and finds the prospect of a movie deal ludicrous. And there is nothing wrong with that. If Casselberry had expressed his disapproval using the same language I just did, he would still be playing baseball; this never would have become a new story and this article would not exist. The cause for concern is Casselberry’s language and its implications. In order to get his tone across, Casselberry immediately defaulted to attacking Mo’Ne’s character via stereotypes of Black female sexuality. Mo’Ne is only thirteen years old. She’s barely a teenager. Casselberry had no grounds to even discuss the sexuality of someone her age. Casselberry’s comment is merely a symptom of a larger problem. The fetishization and sexualization of Black women has been an epidemic plaguing popular culture since as early as the 18th century. Unfortunately, it appears that exotic sensuality has become so deeply entangled in the essence of Black femininity that it has extended to our children. Sexuality is a complex weight that Black women struggle to carry every day. A burden that a young girl’s mind should not be forced carry; is not meant to carry. While I do not agree with Casselberry’s choice of words, his individual stupidity is not my concern. My concern is that this story will be misinterpreted as an isolated incident, when this is a fight Black women and girls are forced to engage in every day. It is the deeply ingrained, largely unopposed and often unaddressed ignorance underlying Casselberry’s tweet that are the real problem. This story is just a surface stain. I hold no ill will towards Casselberry. I think the actions taken by Twitter and Bloomsburg University were appropriate. What will upset me is if society views this issue as resolved. by Julianna Simms         Last Friday, Ta-Nehisi Coates closed his remarks on the case for reparations by saying that slavery isn’t a bump in the road of US history—it is the road. Prof. Kelly Lytle Hernández opened her talk, “Caged Birds: The Birth of Mexican Imprisonment in the United States,” with a similar metaphor that cuts to the quick of systemic racism and the modalities of state oppression in this country. Quoting Patrick Wolfe, Hernández reminded us that “settler-colonialism is a structure, not an event,” and invited us to think of mass incarceration as a project of genocide. The U.S. currently has over 2 million people incarcerated—the largest prison population in the First World—and the nation’s prison complex is the second largest employer in the entire country. Imprisonment is one of the most lucrative industries in our country. Yet it is only recently that scholars have begun the hard work of understanding how the fact of imprisonment fundamentally shapes our culture, our political frame of reference—and the very way we think and act. Hernández’s talk is the second lecture in the Ethnicity, Race and Migration Program’s Spring Lecture series in Latin@ Studies—a schedule of events that seek to account for the underrepresentation of non-white histories, philosophies, and cultures in our curriculum, and combat the epistemic oppression that comes hand-in-hand with such exclusion. Hernández spoke about the real, flesh-and-blood effects of such underrepresentation: Her lecture traced how the settler-imperialism of Anglo-America created the road to Black and Brown mass imprisonment today. To explore both the criminalization of immigrants and the alienation of citizen offenders in the U.S., Hernández delineated how immigration control and mass incarceration emerged at the same time and place as forms of social control over who she calls a “racialized caste of outsiders in the United States today.” To tell this story, Hernández dropped us down in California at the turn of the century. Today, the state has an incarceration industry that generates $1 billion a year. Los Angeles has the largest prison population of any city in the state, and, in a country where Blacks, Latin@s, and Native Americans make up over half of those held in detention, L.A. prisons are overwhelming Hispanic. If you were to look at L.A. in the 1860s, Hernández said, these ratios would be much the same. In the U.S.-Mexican borderlands, mass incarceration became a tool to create, contain and consolidate white control over the most Western part of the country. This was the age of Manifest Destiny; the KKK was once again on the rise, as were Nativist groups, eugenics, and Jim Crow. We can also see paths of immigrant labor and capital beginning to carve themselves like deep and familiar scars: At the close of the 19th century, few Mexicans lived in the United States, but American industries that demanded cheap mass labor were beginning to grow. And so by 1929, 10% of México’s population resided within U.S. borders, working and dying in factories and fields. In a stunning attempt to both reaffirm racist and xenophobic attitudes towards Mexicans and hold on to their necessary labor, U.S. industrialists made the argument that immigrants from South of the border were “homers.” “Like a pigeon,” they said, the Mexican “goes home to roost,” meaning that L.A., the “Aryan City of the Sun,” could stay white, while maintaining a vast class of brown, “pigeon” workers—i.e., my great grandparents. As federal prison facilities in the American borderlands expanded throughout the 1930’s, so did legislation meant to criminalize immigration. The Immigration Act of March 4, 1929 made “unlawfully” entering the U.S. a felony punishable by a fine and a prison sentence of up to one year. The majority of detainees who filled these new facilities were arrested on public order charges: that is, laws meant to deny racialized “others” the right to occupy space and live. These are the same kinds of laws today that validate “Stop and Frisk,” killed Eric Garner, and send thousands of people each year into the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement—to be deported and ripped away from their families, their jobs, and their lives. History tells us that “citizen,” like “human,” is a fundamentally exclusionary category. The simultaneous imprisonment and elimination of entire groups of people is written into the formation of this nation, just as the elimination of entire histories is written into the very way we think about the past. Lessons like these remind you of how little you’ve been taught—and why that is. One type of erasure always leads to another. by Ava Tomasula y Garcia  “You think it’s the hurricane? I think a dead man trying to tell a tale.” Curtis T., a homeless man, was being interviewed by the New Haven Independent about an event that transpired the night before Halloween in 2012. A homeless woman named Katie Carbo was sleeping near an oak tree on the New Haven Green that had been uprooted by Hurricane Sandy when she discovered a human skull in the roots of the tree. It turned out that when all of the headstones were moved from the former cemetery, the bodies were left behind. There are many more skulls cradled in the soil of the Green, more dry bones cracking open under the weight of time. Yale students tend to stay away from the Green, but it is not because of these dead bodies. My first lesson on why I should stay away from the Green came to me on my first day at Yale. My tour group was heading towards Old Campus when I asked my guide if the Green was Yale’s quad. He scoffed. “That’s where the homeless people live. Don’t go there alone unless you want to get shot.” One day in September I was headed to Wooster Square to get a latte from Fuel when I realized that I could cut through the Green to get there. Despite the advice of my tour guide, I decided to take the risk of getting shot to see what lay beneath the rumors and the scorn. The New Haven Green is divided into two large rectangles of grass called the Upper Green and the Lower Green that are parallel to each other and separated by a busy street. When I step onto the Upper Green, the world around me turns murky green. Trees filter the sunlight into a shadowy gray. Benches line the paths, filled with the bodies of those who have nowhere to go. These are people who presumably cannot get a job, a home, or a break. So they sit. It is a warm day, so some bodies are curled up in a fetal position on the grass near the church. On the back wall of a church is a plaque with an inscription that reads: “The dead shall be raised.” The people buried under the Green have stories to tell, but there are even more to be told about those who have walked on top of it. From the fall of 1839 to the summer of 1840, the African prisoners from the slave ship Amistad  got their rationed exercise on its grass as they endured the trial to determine whether or not they were free. The jail that housed them was located on the edge of the Green, and people would pay 12 ½ cents to view the rebellious Africans who resisted the white authority that wanted to condemn them to a life of dehumanizing servitude. People paid to look at the slaves, but now it costs nothing to look at the remains of this legacy of oppression that sleep on the grass of the Green and smoke on its benches. Not every homeless person sleeping in the Green is the descendant of an enslaved African, but many of them are. The sun is still perched in the sky, but a chill has passed through my bones. Only 15 minutes now. I am getting closer to the place where I can sit down and page through my Economics textbook. Wooster Square is only 15 minutes away. To get to the Square I pass through Brownstone Row on Chapel Street which is not open to traffic unless the driver lives in one of the historical houses that line either side of the street. This disconnection from the bustling city streets, this idyllic isolation finds its way to the cadence of my walk as I relax and slow my pace towards Wooster Square. The Square itself is surrounded by impressive historical homes on all sides. It is a public space, but is meant for those who have homes. There are many trees, but the same sun that shone on the New Haven Green is unequal in its distribution. Wooster Square is golden in the late afternoon. Wooster Square was named after General David Wooster, a white man who died while serving in the the Revolutionary War. He graduated from Yale, a place that weaves itself tightly into many stories of New Haven, both past and present. Here in the present a white couple is lying in the grass as I walk by; their bicycles rest beside them. An elderly white woman sits in her wheelchair with her black caretaker beside her. They watch a group of children, some black, mostly not, run through the crunchy leaves that are just beginning to flutter from the trees. What will it take for the people of New Haven to treat the New Haven Green and Wooster Square as equal places to play with their children, enjoy the sunshine, go on a date? While I cannot speak for all of New Haven, I know that when I walked through the Green I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. I could not sit down next to the homeless man sleeping on the grass and pull out my Economics textbook for some reading. That juxtaposition, that reminder of the inequality that America was founded on, makes us uneasy. And yet on many occasions as I walk through Wooster Square, I notice that I am the only black person in the park. On one such occasion, I glanced at the Nalgene water bottle in my hand with “Yale” boldly emblazoned on the side, and I gripped it a little tighter. It made me feel like I belonged, like it was my justification for being in a place that and General Wooster did not mean for me to be in. Occupying space where you are not meant to be is a key tool in social progress. The “Occupy Wall Street” movement of 2012 was particularly felt in New Haven where the Green was home to the longest encampment of protesters in New England. They were protesting the corporate interests and the power imbalances in the U.S. that produce environments as starkly different as Wooster Square and the New Haven Green. They were eventually evicted by the Proprietors, a private group started by the original Founders of New Haven that has owned the Green since 1641. Power has remained in the same hands for generations, and they were able to get the protestors evicted just in time for Yale’s Commencement. When people protest because of a problem in society, the people in power tend to solve this problem by moving the protesters and their problem out of sight. If there is ever a movement to make the Green more like Wooster Square, I am afraid that those in power may choose to simply move the homeless people out of sight without acknowledging that it is more complicated than that. How do you solve a problem grounded in 500 years of original sin? We start by looking at the dry bones under the roots of the trees. The dead shall be raised, but they can only speak the truth about history with the help of the living. by Elizabeth Spenst  					Keep this piece very close by. It is the essence of the purpose of Down. The history of the green, the contast of the green and its history with Wooster, the buried souls and their struggle for purpose, respect and life. The quiet wondering of the writer to question where she fits in.  Mans inhumanity and the never ending pursuit of a place and a home.  Great article!! 					Absolutely wonderful stuff, Liz. Loved the bit about occupying spaces as the key to social progress.        Last Friday, Cross Campus reverberated with the cheers of hundreds of students mobilizing in a call for intersectional solidarity. Last Friday, a moving demonstration of student power and unification cemented a historical milestone for years to come. Last Friday, Unite Yale took place – a rally organized to affirm the tangible connections between the ongoing struggles for cultural center renovations, fossil fuel divestment, mental health policy reform, and the elimination of the student income contribution. At the rally, marginalized voices of the student body were uplifted in a way that can only be described as unparalleled: folks involved with each movement courageously shared their personal stories and spoke of the ways in which our experiences with administrative negligence overlapped. “Us coming together is not just about winning our campaigns more easily and building a big movement,” Lex Barlowe ’17 declared in the closing statement she gave at the rally. “But it is also about who we are, the complexities of our identities, and honoring ourselves in our struggles for justice.” Such a premise seems unusual upon first glance. After all, how could all of these issues possibly be related? I am a low-income Asian student on financial aid, and am working an increasing number of jobs to remain financially independent. As a result of the student income contribution, I live in fear that I will ultimately be unable to pay for my education. If this financial burden persists, I will either have to take out loans – something that Yale guaranteed would not happen, withdraw from Yale, or sacrifice everything that I am passionate about in order to make time for more work hours. Most of what I am currently involved with at Yale is related with the Asian and Pacific American community: a community which is not only housed in a center that is physically dangerous to be inside of, but is also denied the academic opportunity to explore a discipline that encompasses our specific and diverse experiences as colonized bodies, as resistant bodies – as people who endure and create, despite our oppression. To be invalidated in this way can prove psychologically damaging: after all, this is not the first time Asian and Pacific American students, alongside all students of color, have been subtly or explicitly told that our spaces mean little. Throughout all this, working-class people who look like me, immigrants and refugees who fled war-torn countries, are ghettoized into neighborhoods near hazardous waste facilities, exposed to dangerous air pollution and poisoned by toxins as a result. Low-income students deserve the loan-free education we were promised. Students of color deserve better-resourced cultural centers to serve as a base for both our designated community as well as the broader Yale student body. Everyone deserves a mental health system that is fundamentally accessible and doesn’t make us question our own vulnerability, humanity, and needs. Everyone deserves a world that is not being exploited and destroyed by the fossil fuel industry for profit, a phenomenon that most detrimentally affects indigenous populations and poor communities of color – and many of us at Yale are members of these communities that are most devastated by climate change. Here, we arrive full circle. Audre Lorde was fittingly quoted at the rally: “There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle, because we do not live single-issue lives.” At Unite Yale, students joined hands not just in our shared indignation as a result of our demands remaining unaddressed, but also in our collective belief that Yale can do better. Our predecessors fought for the implementation of centers for all marginalized folks on campus, for divestment from South African apartheid and the prison-industrial complex, for the integration of an ethnic studies program – and they all won. There is no reason to believe we cannot win too. Unite Yale, as an ongoing coalition of students fighting for justice, represents the beginning of a student body moving forward, together as one. And they can’t stop us now. by Yuni Chang  Compiled speeches from the Unite Yale Rally for DOWN 					Yes to the Lorde Quote.        As Hilton Als begins his master class on March 25, the classroom is hushed with expectation. Als is distinguished in the literary world for his memoirs, essays, and reviews, but as a queer black man in the literary world he often finds himself pigeonholed into discussions on race and sexuality. He sits before the classroom, listening as he is welcomed with a hearty applause. “I haven’t read from this book since it was published,” he confesses, holding a copy of his 1996 book The Women. The master class is full of students in English 127, who read Hilton Als as part of a syllabus that included Black American voices like James Baldwin, Owen Dodson, and Richard Wright. His smile is professional but warm as he asks the audience, “Tell me what you want to talk about. I don’t want to bore anybody.” Als rejects tokenism  the notion that any one voice can represent the multitudes of emotion and experience that comprise any demographic drawn by race, sexuality, or socioeconomic class. In his essay “The Enemy Within,” he writes, “It was in Baldwin’s essays, unencumbered by the requirements of narrative form, character, and incident, that his voice was most fully realized.” The personal voice is a faithfully cultivated tool in Als’s craft. He recounts the time he spent three days calibrating his desired voice for a chapter in The Women. He identifies the treacherous drive to duty and competition that can cost queer writers of color like Dodson and Baldwin their individual voices. Listening to Hilton Als, I remember his passage from The Women about the competition that minority writers often undertook to distinguish their works to a traditionally white American literary establishment. “Although many, many people knew what Owen [Dodson]’s intellectual and aesthetic tastes were, they never discussed the absence of those tastes from his written work, where he forfeited his vision for the sake of Negro respectability, writing what he felt should be said instead of what he wanted to say,” noted Als. At one point during questions, he chuckled at a long smear of beige paint behind a student’s head. “Sorry,” he said, cracking up. “I keep thinking you’re raising your hand, until I realize that it’s just the paint on the wall.” To a visibly more relaxed, chatty, and smiling classroom, Hilton Als dispensed a final piece of advice before leaving, fingers tapping on the Baldwin and Dodson books as if in warning. “Don’t compete,” he said. “Don’t compete, ever.” by Aretha Guo         A.  Black If you had to choose one letter, which would you choose? Go ahead, pick your strife. But know that it wasn’t a fleeting decision for Blake Brockington, a powerful, 18-year-old Black trans activist from North Carolina who committed suicide just last week. In an interview with the Charlotte Observer, Brockington said, “My family thinks this is a decision I made. They think, ‘You’re already black, why would you want to draw more attention to yourself?’ But it’s not a decision. It’s who I am. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.” The blunt reality for Blake Brockington, as a Black transgender man, was that he was fighting a fight for an intensely marginalized community while being misunderstood and marginalized by one that he should have been able to call his own. During the Civil Rights Movement, Black masculinity became tantamount to a cohesive and united Black community, and hypermasculinity, manifested through violence, became a weapon utilized to defend this community from the attacks of white America. Masculinity, as a tool for resistance, relied on women as an “other” in order to distinguish itself. So, women and non-heteronormative queers within the Black community were silenced. To be transgender or gender non-normative was to uproot the structure that the Black community relied on. Marlon Riggs, a gay African American filmmaker, put it best when he said, “What disturbs –no, enrages – me is not so much the obstacles set before me by whites, which history has conditioned me to expect, but the traps and pitfalls planted by my so-called brothers, who because of the same history should know better.” Even many queer communities that have fought bravely to advance the long overdue rights and civil liberties of lesbian, gay and bisexual peoples have pushed their trans brothers and sisters to the sidelines. Too many times throughout history the “T” in LGBT has been forgotten, and still is today. However, Blake’s suicide was unprecedented because he was an incredible activist, not because he was transgender or Black. A 2012 report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs claimed that transgender people of color were 2.59 times more likely to experience police violence and 2.37 times more likely to experience discrimination than their white, cisgendered counterparts. The report stated, “The intersection of racism and Transphobia can make these survivors and victims more vulnerable to violence and more likely to experience discrimination and violence from first responders.” The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention presents absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable figures of attempted suicides by transgender or gender non-conforming people: 41 percent have self-reported a suicide attempt, compared to the overall national 4.6 percent. Furthermore, at the highest rate, 46 percent of transgender men have reported suicide attempts. Just a month before Blake’s death, two transgender individuals, Ash Haffner, and an activist, Aubrey Mariko committed suicide, only two months after the suicide of Ohio transgender youth, Leelah Alcorn. The nation should be overwhelmed. And with the Trans Murder Monitoring Project reporting that in 2012 a trans person was slain every 72 hours despite comprising less than one percent of the world’s population, so should the world. These were the very statistics Blake Brockington was valiantly combatting, speaking passionately about some of the country’s most polarizing problems, all the while battling his own. Stepping into the national spotlight after having been crowned North Carolina’s first transgender homecoming king, Blake used this momentum to propel himself to the foreground of the trans movement. He spoke at the 2014 Transgender Day of Remembrance in Charlotte and even led protests of police brutality against Black people. Blake was quoted telling the Charlotte Observer, “We have to address all these problems at once – misogyny, patriarchy, LGBT issues, race issues. We have to address everything at once if we plan to change the system at all.” Even in his most powerful moments, inspiring huge groups of people to support the cause, Blake had troubles of his own that plagued his existence: “I’m waiting on a moment when me and my darkness split from my body.” Only a week before his death, Blake posted on his Tumblr account: “being in my head is like being a quarterback playing against an entire defensive line.” Josh Burford, assistant director for sexual and gender diversity at UNC Charlotte, who worked with Blake, told the Charlotte Observer, “What happened to Blake is part of a systemic problem, especially for trans students of color. He didn’t quit. He didn’t give up… He’s a victim of what happens every single day to these kids.” Blake Brockington was an extraordinary human being. His memory will live on throughout countless communities and his words will reverberate throughout the nation: “We [trans individuals] need support, not people looking down at us or degrading us or overlooking us.” Now is the time to start giving the trans community what it demands. Stop glossing over the “T” and start promoting some fucking inclusivity. Being human is hard enough. Being neglected can be fatal. by Jamar Williams         On April 3rd, Tumblr users will once again be confronted with a mosaic of Black beauty curated using the hashtag #BlackOut. Without a doubt, organizing coming out of Ferguson was strengthened by the broad coalition of people of different races and backgrounds who came together to stand firmly in defense of black lives. I continue to be inspired by brave solidarity organizing occurring in the name of #BlackLivesMatter. But what makes these protests powerful and threatening to the status quo are the black masses – the extraordinary amounts of black people that comprise them, who are demanding systemic change and the right to self-determination and space. Amidst overwhelming fear, confusion, and anger, it often felt like there was nothing else we could do but take to the streets. While the moment after the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson catapulted months of widespread protest, the protests often lacked direction and suffered from too many white people making things about themselves. But we were there. We came out of our homes, we spoke up and out, and we claimed our right to outrage, to justice, and to our own voices. The confrontation of mass black presence, or in other words, of blackness itself, is hugely important beyond physical space, as well. Today, Friday April 3rd, will mark the second Tumblr #BlackOut. First happening on Friday March 6th, the purpose of the Tumblr #BlackOut is to flood the website with selfies taken by black people anywhere and everywhere as a celebration of black power, beauty, and voice. Happening the first Friday of every month, #BlackOut demands that Tumblr users see black people and blackness all day long. The backlash to #BlackOut from many non-black Tumblr users, which named the action as aggressive and contentious, is a further testament to its necessity. Black people have internalized the need to be small and stay out of the way of white people. We have historically been told that we do not deserve space and that we do not deserve to be seen or heard. Blocking traffic, sitting in, and dominating Tumblr rejects that. It proudly states that we are here, we belong, we matter, and we will not go away – terrifying and empowering things for black people to say. It is a threat to the status quo of white supremacy. It does not matter whether white people support #BlackOut. Fighting for the rights of our people is fighting for the rights of ourselves. By taking up space, be it in the streets, on the Internet, or beyond, we can become the fullest versions of ourselves instead of the stifled versions we are taught to be. We can push authentic survival for black people from a process of figuring out what parts of ourselves we have to limit in order to get by, to a bold demand for being everything that we can be. by Alexandra Barlowe         DOWN Magazine emerged out of the silences intentionally and unintentionally created by the overwhelming whiteness of Yale’s journalistic landscape. These gaping holes motivated us to create a publication that would not only enrich the communities in which it is grounded, but also create an outlet for the news, voices, and arts that have been pent up inside students of color for so long. In the past these efforts were housed in individual cultural communities, but DOWN is unique because we strive to create a space that both honors the specificity of the many cultures our writers bring to the table while also drawing connections between them. An organic intersectionality has always been one of our guiding principles. And that sensibility is even more essential in the face of campus conversations where identity, when it is mentioned, is often understood as static and one-dimensional. DOWN seeks to write from a perspective where the intersections are at the forefront of the writing rather than an afterthought. It is true that race is central to DOWN, but more than that our writers – who are also gay, straight, bisexual, low-income, wealthy, funny and articulate – are what ground this publication. They’re smart. And their insights on all issues, racial and otherwise, are going to change the way we all view the world. Yale should be the last place for this kind of talent to go to waste. But in the case of campus publications, there is so much lost potential for important narratives, perspectives, and even breaking news because of the lack of inclusivity and respect for writers of color and the issues about which they are passionate that many students of color choose not to write at all. DOWN is also a space where these writers in waiting can find the encouragement, constructive criticism, and room that they need to get started. The results so far have been badass – if you do not believe us, browse this website and see how powerfully students of color communicate truth in written form once we find a space that values our contributions and us. If journalism is the pursuit of truth, then the “objective” aggregation of facts, often produced by institutions invested in a certain status quo, hardly fits that description. DOWN is part of a larger journalistic movement that seeks to challenge our society’s woefully flawed notion that corporate or elite publications are invested in telling the whole, objective truth. We seek to transcend and redefine the possibilities of the place of journalism in shaping American society – and what better group of people to bring this perspective to our campus than we, the students of color, those with the ability to critically analyze this white supremacist world objectively, using our position as outsiders looking in to our empirical advantage. We are here, we have carved out our space, and we are not going anywhere. by Eshe Sherley and Sebastian Medina-Tayac, Managing Editors for DOWN Magazine         “Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shore, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy.” – Martin Luther King, Jr., from “Why We Can’t Wait” (1963) In recent weeks, a 15-year-old girl was assaulted by a New Haven Police Officer and just this past Tuesday, video footage surfaced of Walter Scott murdered by Officer Michael Slager over a traffic violation. Though the fire of Ferguson may have seemed to die down, its spirit lives on like burning embers, inhabiting our bodies and bodies across the nation. A few month ago as we stood outside the Native American Cultural Center, cleansing ourselves with sage and a light rain, we could hear echoes of a Black Lives Matter demonstration flooding the streets of New Haven. While we mourned the massacre of about two hundred peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho people that occurred 150 years ago, masses of people mourned the death of Michael Brown and Eric Garner just a few months ago. Our chants of “We cry out” faded into “Eric Garner, Michael Brown, shut it down, shut it down.” We lit candles, sang, and prayed for the stolen lives at Sand Creek and throughout Indian country. At the same time, protesters marched and held a die-in demonstration to demand justice. The spirits of the Native American and African American communities could not have felt more connected to me than in these short moments. It was a beautiful reminder that the struggle against systemic racism and state brutality is a fight we all share. Although we are ethnically different, and although our experiences have been vastly different, our fates are linked. On November 29th, 1864, 700 armed Colorado militiamen attacked a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho village and killed about two hundred people, most of whom were women, children, and older men. The Union army, led by Colonel John Chivington, scalped, mutilated, and paraded the villagers lifeless bodies. Chief Black Kettle had raised an American flag over Fort Lyon in anticipation of passing U.S. troops to signal alliance with the U.S. However, the flag was ignored and during the brutal onslaught a white flag of capitulation was raised in desperation, but the soldiers continued on their rampage. Hands up, don’t shoot. In the years preceding the Sand Creek Massacre, the U.S. signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, which recognized the traditional territories of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Sioux, Crow, Assiniboine, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara. The US would respect traditional land claims and give annuity to the tribes, as long as they could build forts on Indian land to ensure safe passage for Americans on the Oregon and Santa Fe trails to get to the California gold rush) and in exchange, allowed the U.S. to build forts on these territories. The Cheyenne and Arapaho were forced to cede most of their lands by 1861. With the onset of the Civil War, the U.S. forces in Colorado became more militarized, and Governor John Evans developed a harsh attitude towards Indians. As Colin Calloway, Professor of History and Professor of Native American Studies at Dartmouth, puts it, over time “war became so common in Indian country, wars against Indians such a recurrent feature of early American history, that it was easy to assume Indians were warlike by nature and therefore merited treatments as ‘savages.’ The Indian wars also, some would say, left a more sinister mark on American culture: a nation built on conquest could not escape the legacy of its violent past.” The combination of hundreds of years of oppressive and vicious attitudes towards Native Americans and the militarization of the U.S. forces would culminate in the genocide and ethnic cleansing that took place at Sand Creek. Simon J. Ortiz of the Acoma Pueblo published From Sand Creek to memorialize and honor the Cheyenne and Arapaho people who lost their lives in 1864. Ortiz juxtaposes historical narrative with free form poetry to grapple with the legacy of Sand Creek. His poetry works against the exclusion of Native Americans in U.S. history and challenges the master narrative of “discovery,” retracing the roots of this nation back to its indigenous population, who had inhabited Turtle Island for thousands of years. He describes the transgenerational suffering, writing: “They crossed country / that would lay / beyond memory. / Their cells / would no longer bother / to remember. / Memory / was not to be trusted.” These lines describe the distressing issue of the American governments denial of the mass genocide of Native peoples, an issue that has effectively made all of American society, easily forgetting to look down at its own bloodied hands,ignorant and indifferent to what its government had to do to become what it is today. It was only fate that the uprisings catalyzed by the Michael Brown case in Ferguson fall on the 150th anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre. There was indictment for neither Darren Wilson in the Michael Brown case, after he shot the unarmed teenager, nor Daniel Pantaleo in the Eric Garner case, after he killed the father of six with an illegal chokehold. Although the actions of Colonel Chivington were condemned, he was only forced to resign without any criminal charges being brought against him. These are stories seen repeatedly throughout history of the United States allowing the genocide of the marginalized peoples in its society. Now, more than ever, the African American and Native Americans communities, along with other minorities, are uniting over their shared pain and in the fight for equality, crying out “Idle No More” and “No Justice, No Peace.” by Leanne Motylenski  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWNApFxpRA0        My first name is Karléh – the Ghanian word for “lovely”. My middle name is Ashanta, which is an extension of the Swahili word for life, “Asha”. In some Southeast Native American tribes, Ashanta means Princess. And for the Ashanti tribe in Ghana, having the name Ashanta denotes royal blood. So, my name can be interpreted as meaning “Lovely Life” or “Lovely Princess”. Either way, my name has always meant more to me than just an arrangement of letters on a birth certificate. My mother is a Creek Indian, and family names are an important part of her culture. She wanted to recreate a Creek naming ceremony used to name Native children. However, because one of the elders in my family is Nigerian and speaks many languages from the African continent, he was the one he picked the names. So while my names are Ghanaian, the way that I received my name represents my mother’s Native American culture. People often mispronounced my name as Karlee Wilson. It did not even occur to me that people were mispronouncing my name, I just assumed that they weren’t talking to me. As a young girl, I never had a problem correcting people when they mispronounced my name. By default, I was able to relate to the kids in my class whose names were Marissa Sanchez, Abel Gonzales, Joceline Silva, Giovanna Leyva, etc. I recognized these kids pronounced their names differently from the way the teachers did. So I made it a point to repeat their names to them in the Spanish accent that I heard them say them in. When I moved to California, some of my new classmates asked me if it would be alright if they just called me “Karlee” since it was easier for them. I was dumbfounded by the question, as I’d never received it in Louisiana. I had always just assumed that white people lacked an ability to pronounce words that were not English. But in California, I quickly learned that this proposal to go by Karlee was essentially an invitation to participate in whiteness with them. There were no Mexican immigrants at my new school in California, but there were Asian Americans. I was surprised to learn that these Asian Americans had Anglicized names to use at school, but usually went by names from their respective Asian countries when at home. I asked them what their real names were in an effort to stand in solidarity with them.  I was appalled at their unwillingness to teach me how to say their names. I eventually realized that I was actually offending them because they didn’t want their names mispronounced by their American peers. Still, using Anglicized names allowed Asian American students to more easily connect with their white peers – even though it was still on white peoples’ terms. The strategic use of identification by many people of color allows them to enter into white spaces while evading unnecessary hostility. But our names are our treasure, and they hold more meaning to us than an identifying marker. For people of color whose names are phonetically mispronounced by American English standards, our names are acts of resistance against microaggressions that stifle our cultural creativity. Today, I wear my name proudly. My Facebook account features the accent mark on the E so that people know that my name is not simply a stylized version of Karlee. I am thankful for my teachers and friends who pronounce my name correctly the first time, for they are complimenting me more than they realize. To say my name correctly is to stand in solidarity with my cultural heritage. by Karléh Wilson  					Names carry power.  Keep holding onto your own.        World-renowned drummer Sheila E. shouted into the audience with an unapologetic defiance and power that exemplified the spirit of “Black Girls Rock!” — the television special dedicated to awarding the achievements of young Black women. As the awardees took the stage, I was thrilled to watch something on TV that finally showed Black women in a positive light. I saw role models I never knew I could have — artists, educators, and entrepreneurs who had changed their communities through their hard work. But many people didn’t feel inspired; for them, the awards aroused anger. The awards — which have run on BET for five years — have frequently been called “reverse racist.” In 2013, the hashtag “#WhiteGirlsRock” flooded Twitter in response to the program. What’s more, when Michelle Obama spoke at this year’s “Black Girls Rock!” awards last Sunday, social media erupted with criticism. Some viewers said that she sent a message to white girls that they don’t matter. Everyone deserves equal and fair representation on our television screens and in the pages of our magazines. But unfortunately, television shows rarely boast Black protagonists and appearances of Black women in leading roles are even scarcer. “Black Girls Rock!” is essential because it makes a statement against this flagrant lack of positive images of Black women in the media. Too often, Hollywood appropriates Black culture while simultaneously criticizing it and popularizing negative stereotypes against people of color. Furthermore, awards committees rarely recognize the work of Black women. For instance, it wasn’t until this year — the 72nd Golden Globes — that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated a Black woman for best director. The show’s critics are quick to say that “Black Girls Rock!” discriminates against white girls, yet they often omit other women of color from their argument. The hashtag that trended in 2013 was #WhiteGirlsRock, not #AllGirlsRock. It excluded women of color from the conversation about discrimination and represents the notion that the inclusion of white people is necessary for a narrative to be considered legitimate. It categorizes women of color as “other,” and therefore not worthy of the praise that white women deserve. In addition, the hashtag intensifies the Black-white binary that feeds into the oppositional dualism that strengthens discrimination. #WhiteGirlsRock epitomizes the precise lack of recognition for people of color that led to the necessity for a program like “Black Girls Rock!” Proclaiming, “Black Girls Rock” is not synonymous with saying, “White Girls Don’t Rock.” Instead, it’s a seldom-heard reminder that Black girls have achieved and will continue to achieve great things. by Sarah Bruley         Between the grassroots support that emerged from #BlackLivesMatter, the student-led organizing of cultural center reform campaigns, the Fossil Free movement, financial aid reform protests, and now the project to Unite Yale, there has been an immense growth of activism on campus. Although there have always been a handful of Yalies who were willing to throw together signs or grab a bullhorn, the momentum as of late has definitely been different. The crowds have grown; the demonstrations have gone on longer. Clearly, direct action is gaining ground at Yale, and as the activism grows, one question keeps bothering me. Where are the cries of Black/Red/Brown Power? Now that Unite Yale has finally brought forth the bold utterance of “student power” (hearkening back to the days of Students for a Democratic Society and the growth of the New Left in the late 1960s), maybe it’s time to bring it all back. But why should we bring it back? In 2015, there is no war in Vietnam. There is no draft. Our President is Black. The so-called “Civil Rights Era” is long behind us. What place is there for this kind of rhetoric today? It is in reading Stokely Carmichael’s 1966 address at the University of California, Berkeley that I find the answers to these questions. This 1966 speech is entitled, “Black Power,” and it resonates intensely today. Are we willing to be concerned about the black people who will never get to Berkeley, who will never get to Harvard, and cannot get an education, so you’ll never get a chance to rub shoulders with them and say, ‘Well, he’s almost as good as we are; he’s not like the others’? First and foremost, these are the kinds of questions we need to start asking our fellow Yale students. Students of color at this university have the opportunity to get Carmichael’s “Well, he’s almost as good as we are; he’s not like the others.” In the eyes of privileged society, many of us have a shot at individual power, but racism was never about individual power, and there is no way that its solution can be. Carmichael reminds his audience: “We are oppressed as a group because we are black, not because we are lazy, not because we’re apathetic, not because we’re stupid, not because we smell, not because we eat watermelon and have good rhythm. We are oppressed because we are black. And in order to get out of that oppression one must wield the group power that one has, not the individual power which this country then sets the criteria under which a man may come into it.” And there’s the truth of the matter. Your Yale education may save you. Your ability to code switch may save you. Growing up middle class may save you. Your parents’ education may save you. Your individual status, granted to you by a system that was only designed to oppress you in the first place, will never save your people. Only power can do that. So we must escape being remarkable individuals. We must reject the temptation to allow ourselves to be “not like the others.” After all, when we’re walking down the street, we will be perceived as little more than our race. Even at a place we might like to call home, we might get guns pulled on us because we “fit the description.” Through our racialization, we are deprived of power. By being coded as something other than “white” in the United States, we are marginalized, and our very being is delegitimized. In “Black Power,” Stokely Carmichael and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee find a solution to that delegitimization. Who has power to make his or her acts legitimate?…[In] this country, that power is invested in the hands of white people, and they make their acts legitimate. It is now, therefore, for black people to make our acts legitimate. Carmichael and SNCC did not wait to be taken seriously by the government. Carmichael and SNCC did not follow proper channels. Carmichael and SNCC simply decided that they had the ability to legitimize themselves. The power that gave Carmichael and SNCC their own legitimacy in the face of the opposition from the hegemonic state was Black Power. For the American Indian Movement it was Red Power. For the Chicano Movement it was Brown Power. In 2015, it’s time to bring our power back. The project of nation-building may be a lofty one, but it is one that can, and should begin with us. Even with the smallest of fights. Even here at Yale. After all, Carmichael didn’t believe that students should sit back and wait until graduation to make a difference: I don’t think that we should follow what many people say that we should fight to be leaders of tomorrow. Frederick Douglass said that the youth should fight to be leaders today. And God knows we need to be leaders today, ’cause the men who run this country are sick, are sick. So that can we on a larger sense begin now, today, to start building those institutions and to fight to articulate our position, to fight to be able to control our universities–we need to be able to do that–and to fight to control the basic institutions which perpetuate racism by destroying them and building new ones? Carmichael’s “today” was in 1966, but his charge retains its urgency. Can we rededicate ourselves to that fight? by Javier Cienfuegos         “Ignorance is a cure for nothing” – W.E.B. Dubois For the last stop on our route, we tour guides like to end with a brief anecdote about why we chose Yale. For me, the exact words of the speech change every time, but the larger theme is the same: community. That is why I chose Yale. Yale was one of the last schools that I visited and, up until that point, it was not my first choice. When I stepped on Yale’s campus on that fateful day in October of 2013, I was stunned by the sheer beauty of campus. More compelling, however, were the people. From my very first moments on campus, the sense of community was palpable and that sensation has continued to grow with the number of Yalies I encounter. I never cease to be amazed by the complexity, authenticity and exceptional quality of the Yale student community. A recent event on social media, however, has called my understanding of the Yale community into question and, based on conversations I have had regarding this issue, I am not the only one who has been somewhat disillusioned. On April 9th, a Black freshman was bullied, berated and threatened on the social media platform Yik Yak. The comments posted were backlash resulting from an exchange that occurred on Facebook earlier in the day. The incident was sparked by a status posted to the Facebook page “Overheard at Yale” describing a mugging that occurred near campus earlier that day. The status encouraged students to be on the lookout for a suspect described by the author of the post as a, “Black male wearing black hoodie, black scarf with white Fs on it, and black pants headed towards Whitney near Edwards.” The young woman, concerned about what she feared was too vague of a depiction, responded urging the author of the post to increase the specificity of his description. The author responded with a more detailed outline of the suspect’s appearance, but was certain to include his frustration at the request in light of the crime – to which his wife had been made victim – and the sensitive emotional state of both he and his family as a result. Other Facebook users also responded criticizing the Yale freshman for her commentary on the post, stating that the original description was “reasonable” and the request to edit it, “unnecessary” and “poorly timed.” The conversation then shifted media platforms and devolved. What resulted can only be described as a baffling mixture of social commentary featuring brief moments of rational rhetoric – both critiquing and supporting the young woman’s request – completely overshadowed by reoccurring notes of bigotry, hatred and violence. Yik Yak was overflowing with comments calling out the freshman by name, berating her, and even threatening her life on a few occasions. All of this occurred, of course, under the veil of anonymity making it impossible to identify any of the cyber-assailants by name, gender, or race. The popular response to this incident has been a mixed bag of horror, skepticism and (shockingly) support and understanding for the cyberbullies. Students have responded to other reports of this event basically stating that responsibility lies with the victim. That is to say, if she had not made the request or criticism of the original Facebook post, none of this would have unfolded. Other students claim “hypersensitivity” is the issue, claiming minority students, specifically Black students, are too quick to brand a comment as “racist” or “micro-aggressive.” One Yik Yak comment even affirmed the “angry Black woman” stereotype, citing it as accurate and using this case an example. As a Black woman myself, someone who was incredibly disturbed by this incident and an opponent of bullying in any form, I disagree. “Hypersensitivity” is not the issue. This perceived “alertness” within the Black community and all communities of color is a result of a perceived threat. An apparent danger to our community that has been in existence since our arrival to the Americas and, just recently, dominating news headlines, air waves and social media. Today’s media platforms have brought the racial undercurrent of our country to the surface, making it ever palpable and impossible to ignore. That is a kind of droning fear that white student cannot and will not ever be able to fully understand. by Julianna Simms        My skin is somewhere between caramel and yellow. My ex used to describe it as going from Mexican to Middle Eastern to lighter than him, a natural redhead.  It was always a comparison of how dark I was compared to his pale, ghostlike skin. I didn’t realize anything was strange until after a conversation with my current boyfriend, a dark-skinned man of West African descent. While jokingly trading stories of our most awkward hookups and encounters, he offered a tale of being praised for his blackness, and then promptly being called daddy. He concluded with a final punchline “She was a white girl so she must have been confused.” As I got over my fits of laughter I tried to push through my own story. “He told me to say I wanted to have his white babies.” Laughter faded from the room as quickly as if the ceiling fan had captured it. My man looked at me and said somberly: “That’s really fucked up.” Uncomfortable, I acknowledged that it was, and the fact I had stayed with him for years after that made it worse. We could both relate to the pain of being the objects of “jungle fever” by well-meaning paramours. We empathized with each others’ experiences and acknowledged our shared struggles as Black people however different our complexions were. I didn’t question it until other people began to. Members of his family saw pictures of us together on Facebook, and were amused that their boy had a persistent habit of dating white girls. I laughed extremely hard when I first heard this over the phone, picturing myself as the perfect complement to his Yale education. Of course he would be dating a white girl, he should be as romantically successful as he is academically. Growing up in a small, rural town in North Carolina and dating a white guy made people perceive me as Black in a way that I hadn’t experienced before. Back in my days living in North Minneapolis in a Section 8 housing district I was considered “white.” I spoke “white,” didn’t go to Black church (I’m Muslim), tried to make my long hair pressed straight, and tied it with ribbon instead of beads and rubber bands. I hated to be called white. I was painfully aware that the lack of pigment in my skin was the dream for the illegitimate children of slave masters, the nightmare for Black mothers, the stain on white family trees. Remembering this sparked anger at being called white once again. I expressed my indignation and my man assured me he had attempted to explain to his family the fact that I was mixed: part Latina and part Black and part “other.” But it didn’t matter; my light skin only means one thing and that was its color. It was closer to white so I was white. “They always thought I had a thing for white girls.” He sheepishly stated. I grimaced at the thought, a common fear for Black women. “Why does it matter? You know what you are,” he asked. The summer before my junior year of high school my ex and I were buying sandwiches at a local shop and struck up a conversation with the owner. Small town businesses always have time for small talk and the subject of my race and his whiteness always made conversation. She was so inspired by our young love that she gave us a free sandwich, with promises for more if we returned. I was delighted to receive positive attention rather than the stares we usually received. Aside from the race difference, he was generally known as a wrestling and football jock and I a quiet bookworm. Positive attention was few and far between. The opposite is true of my man now. Though we elicit the same stares wherever we go: getting froyo, dancing at parties or even grabbing a meal in the dining hall, the attention is almost always positive. People will remark on how we are a beautiful couple or call us stunning. I can’t help but wish to be left alone. I suppose it’s because in our picturesque appearance I am the “white” one this time, the daring one who dates a dark skinned person despite the stigma of doing so. My man is seen, to the general and colored community, as having the ultimate prize, a beautiful light skinned woman on his arm. I am the trophy, not the trophy winner. Some part of me thinks I’m crazed, tainted by the hypersensitivity that plagues our campus and race relations today. After all, how could anyone mean anything negative when calling my man and me a beautiful couple? I don’t want to be the light skinned Black, non-Spanish speaking Latina or the white girl with no white blood to speak of. by Sarah Pearl Heard  					Love this! Such a unique perspective        Dear Audre, How do you deal with white people who act like they “get it,” but clearly do not? Best, It’s Hard Out Here _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Hey It’s Hard Out Here, First things first, you have the right to be annoyed. So often, people of color who are friends with white folks don’t call them out for being ignorant because they’re genuinely trying to be sensitive or participate in conversations about race. Sometimes that’s not good enough and it’s okay to acknowledge that and ask for more from our white friends. The problem with the dynamic you have highlighted is that one friend is assuming that because they’ve read some literature about race, or consider themselves “down” with their friend’s culture, they fully understand their friend’s experiences as they relate to race. That’s the first big no-no of being a good ally. Don’t assume. Lean into not knowing, because while there are rich opportunities for you to learn from your friend’s relationship to their race/ethnicity/culture (and you ought to try!), you will never fully understand their experience. Now, It’s Hard Out Here, what are some strategies you can use to deal with your friend? Some people ain’t worth your time. Doesn’t have to be dramatic. It might not even merit an intervention or long conversation. Instead use that time to do you. Go forth, Audre        Alonzo Page is a senior in Jonathan Edwards College.

The internet is ablaze with the widely circulated story of Rachel Dolezal, a woman from Spokane, WA who after years of passing herself off as black, has been revealed to be a white by her own parents. As Steven W Thrasher said in an astute article for The Guardian: “…the reason that her story is so fascinating to me and to the rest of the world is that it exposes in a disquieting way that our race is performance – that, despite the stark differences in how our races are perceived and privileged (or not) by others, they are all predicated on a myth that the differences are intrinsic and intrinsically perceptible.” But that’s not the message most people out in the universe of blogs, twitter, and television seem to be taking away from the scandal. Instead of recognizing this as an opportunity to nuance our collective understanding of race, we are spending our energy mocking Dolezal because she was delusional enough to think that she wouldn’t get caught. On twitter, the hoopla has taken the form of the hashtag #AskRachel, where people post questions from black pop culture and list multiple choice answers that black people ought to get, but a white person wouldn’t (You can check them out here. As much as I’m annoyed by the phenomenon, they’re funny as hell). On the other end of the spectrum, people are expressing outrage that a white woman would be so absurdly presumptuous that she not only tried to pass as black, but also is raising black kids and is the President of her local NAACP – I mean really! Y’all. We need to get it together. If we truly believed what the so-called “woke” among us like to post on Facebook – that race is a social construct – then those of us who aren’t from Spokane or in the Dolezal family would pay this woman, and this story, no mind. Because Rachel Dolezal is small potatoes. She’s a distraction. So what if she passed as black for a bunch of years? At least she used that time to participate in the struggle for civil rights through her service to her local NAACP. Is her net contribution to the black community any less than somebody like Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who uses his position to actively tear down policies that the black community so sorely needs? Thrasher’s point that Rachel Dolezal’s strange racial charade shows us the artificiality of race, should also remind us that in our work to ultimately tear down those categories, we must avoid playing harmful identity politics. As much as race, class, sexuality, etc. are important in terms of how we engage in social justice work, what’s most important is who’s doing the work. And it seems as if Dolezal was not only doing the work, but also went about it in a way that garnered her respect in her local community. And so as we waste our energy debating the meaning of why a random white woman tried to pass as black – what are the costs? One of the costs is that we’ve redirected our energy away from the black folks being murdered by the white supremacist system that gave someone like Dolezal the gall to think she could become a black person. We’ve focused our attention on a random white woman. While black people are out here dying and protesting and fighting for justice. Let that sink in. Then let’s get it together and refocus on what actually matters. by Eshe Sherley  					While I appreciate the perspective, I found it pretty belittling. I like to think that even the minor players effect the overall impact. And while Rachel may be just one woman (so is Abigail Fisher) she has ushered in a new chapter of racial politics that cant be ignored if only for the fact that it adds an interesting new chapter/layer/dimension. Her strategy/identity(?) could change who our allies/antagonists are and how they conduct themselves in strategically black spaces        My freshman year, I signed up to take a freshman seminar called “Feminism, Racism, Gender, and Sexuality” because I had never thought of these four terms in conjunction with one another. By the fourth class meeting, I realized that this class was a safe space for me to speak about my own experiences as a Queer Black woman in the United States. By the eighth class, however, I realized that navigating Feminist theory is more complicated for Black women than the Feminist movement is ready to acknowledge. Learning about the intersectionality of racism and sexism helped me to realize that my problems were complex, and that I was not alone in my feelings. The texts that we read validated my confusion, and liberated my mind. I saw Feminism as a way to empower myself through the support of other women. As long as I tacked the term “Feminism” onto my statements, I believed, other women (especially women of color) would both agree with me and defend me, and men would bow down and listen to whatever I had to say. Instead, Feminist discourse made me bitter. Throughout my efforts to speak for myself and defy the odds that are stacked against me, I am still struggling to connect with other Feminists. In the freshman seminar we read several authors who showed how expressions of Black femininity resisted racist misogyny. We further learned how transgender women utilize the tools of Black femininity to empower themselves. Theory about Feminism told me that Queer Black women are the most underrepresented, misunderstood, and mistreated demographic in our society. Realizing that I was severely oppressed was depressing. I always had high self esteem growing up, and never saw myself as a Black woman in society, but rather as an individual being. I never realized that there were elements of the social world that I did not have access to because of my race, gender, and sexuality. Rather than using healthy introspection to deal with my issues, (as I always have) I started to look outward and blame the patriarchy for my problems. Because I did not have a balance, contemporary feminist theory has handicapped my emotional growth. I am obsessively searching for power in every stratosphere possible, and this is a draining and depressing chore. Because of this unfair burden of power-seeking, I have blamed my issues on people in my life who do not embody my version of Feminism. I have answered my moral qualms with Feminist theory, and this is very dangerous, because Feminism was not created for me as a Black woman. Black Feminist intellectual discourse collides with Black Feminism in pop culture in a way that offers no satisfying answers. Because of this contention, I am surrounded by contradictions and complications that obscure my path toward empowerment. Like third-wave Feminist icons Audre Lorde and bell hooks, I publicly denounced Beyoncé because she called herself a Feminist, placing me in conflict with a younger generation of Black Feminists who see the pop star as a Feminist icon. When Beyoncé is on stage and moves in ways that I don’t ever want people to expect me to move; when she Photoshops in thigh-gaps on Instagram; when she tells other “bitches” to “bow down”  I want to tell everyone that she is not a Feminist. In a world where Beyoncé is the “Queen” of Black Feminism, I have been expected to straighten my hair, put in blonde streaks, and have a certain body figure. Like her. Beyoncé’s feminism offends me, but it is not fair for me to say that Beyoncé is not empowered, nor is it fair to antagonize other women who own their sexualities differently than I do mine. I also do not want to be coopted into Beyoncés feminism when it does not serve my liberation. I want to point at women like Lauryn Hill, and demand that she be the face of Black Feminism in pop culture. Why? Because Lauryn Hill looks like me. I want to decide who represents Black female power, and that’s a problem. by Karléh Wilson        In the wake of the Charleston Massacre, defenders of the Confederate flag have emerged en masse in an attempt to maintain the lie that the flag is a benign and significant symbol of Southern heritage. When I enter the fray to object, I am told that it isn’t my place to tell other people how to relate to their heritage. The implicit understanding behind this being that I, as a black woman, am an outsider who could never understand. What they don’t know is that I am a biracial black woman born and raised in Georgia. Both branches of my family tree have roots that stretch back through Jim Crow, Reconstruction, and the Civil War all the way to the American Revolution. So let’s talk about our Southern heritage. Many people argue that the flag’s prominence is a reflective of a deep commitment to history and to being faithful to the entire history of the South. However, the Confederate flag is a prominent feature in Southern life, because for many Southerners the values of the Confederacy still resonates. So what is the root of this resonance? Some pro-flag folks argue that they admire Confederates’ commitment to states’ rights. It is apparently irrelevant to these people that the Confederates took no pains to hide the fact that their own commitment to state’s rights stemmed primarily from their desire to continue owning slaves. Surely people who have a more sincere theoretical commitment to limiting the power of the federal government can find a better intentioned, less fraught example in support of their ideas than the civil war. Still, my favorite reason I’ve heard people give for why they fly the Confederate Flag is that to take down the flag is a form of historical censorship that sugar coats the past. Personally, I am all for remembering the Confederacy, and I appreciate that so many pro-flag folks share this commitment. That’s why all of these Confederate memorial plaques include tidbits like: The rape of female slaves was a pervasive part of plantation culture. It was not uncommon to cut off the foot of a slave who attempted to run away. After giving birth, female slaves were forced to leave their infants on the side of the fields where they were sometimes killed by snakes. At this point, all that’s left is for someone to say is “You’re denying my ability to celebrate any of the history of the region I love. What’s even left?” If you would like to celebrate an enslaved Southerner who demonstrated extraordinary bravery and whose story is related to the history of Emanuel African Methodist, I would suggest you look into Denmark Vesey. But if flags are what really do it for you, might I suggest that the symbol of the Lowndes Country Freedom Party, a black third party alternative to the segregationist Democratic Party in Alabama, would make a good flag? And if the thought of the above listed drum majors for justice and revolutionaries who lived and died fighting for freedom doesn’t fill you with Southern pride, and if you choose to place the Confederate flag at the centerpiece of your Southern heritage  then you’re a racist. Because when it comes down to it, flying the Confederate flag is a racist act done by racist people. All the explanations in the world are just red herrings meant to distract people from the fact that the flag is a symptom. What we really need to fight is the underlying disease of racism that permeates every aspect of life in America, not just the South. As a Southerner, hate is neither my inheritance nor my heritage. The will to fight injustice is. It is a potent legacy, and one that when put at the center of Southern heritage has the power to do more than displace a symbol of hate. It has the power to pull racism up by its very roots. By Micah Jones                 I spent a healthy portion of my freshman year being told that I should fear the streets beyond Popeye’s. Now in my junior year, I see students unwilling to venture too far beyond the wrought-iron gates; I overhear upperclassmen pass on the culture of fear to the next generation of Yalies. New Haven is a city, and cities have crime. But the warnings that we hear are tinged with mistrust of our neighbors, based on disrespect and discrimination. New Haven is home to over 100,000 residents, the majority of whom are people of color. So, when Yalies learn to fear their environment, they are also implicitly learning to fear people of color. This is unacceptable. At Yale, learning to fear thy neighbor of color feeds into the harmful racial dichotomy on campus that makes many students feel they have to code switch — change their demeanor based on the racial makeup of their surroundings to prove that they are an exception to the stereotype. There are few voices at Yale that speak out against our culture of disrespect. But our current Ward 1 Alder, Sarah Eidelson, is not one of them. As an alder who oversees a ward comprised of 85 percent Yale students, she has had the opportunity to be a bridge between Yalies and New Haveners. But instead of encouraging Yalies to look beyond our ivory towers, she has remained silent. By holding a position of power, yet doing nothing to challenge these harmful dynamics, Sarah is actively complicit in perpetuating negative attitudes towards New Haveners. I don’t want to support a candidate who thinks that only appearing on campus during election season and writing #BlackLivesMatter on a campaign website is enough to change the status quo. I want to see a representative who is actively building coalitions of Yalies and New Haveners—who will change the culture on Yale’s campus. That is why I support Fish Stark. Yale’s culture of fear, distrust, and discrimination isn’t going to change unless Yalies are re-introduced to New Haven. Yalies aren’t going to stop calling New Haven residents “Townies” until they learn to appreciate the Elm City and its people. Since freshman year, Fish has been working towards changing the dynamic between Yale and New Haven. He has worked as a teacher in New Haven over the past two summers, encouraging others to engage in community service along the way. On the Yale Dems board, he got freshman involved in the city by organizing them to canvass for Governor Malloy. More importantly, he has spoken out against harmful campus attitudes towards New Haven. I am confident that as Ward 1 alder, he will continue to encourage Yalies to engage with New Haven, not fear it. Anything else would be unacceptable. by Sarah Bruley photo by Cesar Garcia-Lopez        At the time of its destruction, Windows on the World, located on the top floors of the North Tower, had the highest profits of any American restaurant, with possibly one of the most diverse restaurant staff. In 2006, survivors opened the restaurant Colors to honor their 73 fallen co-workers and support those who lost their jobs and means to support their family. Reflecting on the events from 14 years ago on this day, consider how this “World” tragedy is memorialized. Rene Alegria, the CEO and founder of Mamiverse, an online space dedicated to connecting Latina mothers and families, recalls befriending many of the undocumented workers of Windows on the World. These workers would get up early in the morning to start preparing breakfast on the 106th and 107th floors of the tower, circumstances that made surviving the attacks nearly impossible. Rafael Hernandez, a Mexican firefighter who migrated to the U.S. in 1999, volunteered at Ground Zero, subjecting his bodies to high levels of toxins and carcinogens. He worked at the site for 3 months and later led Frontiers of Hope, a group that supported workers dealing with the physical and psychological effects brought on by working the clean up of Lower Manhattan. Unfortunately, Hernandez died of health issues that were greatly exacerbated by his service. He was planning to return to his family in Mexico after getting his last paycheck. The Asociación Tepeyac, owing its namesake to the site of visitation of Our Lady of Guadalupe to St. Juan Diego, worked not only to identify los desparecidos, the missing migrant workers, but also to aid the affected families and those who lost their jobs in a tragedy that did not “discriminate between legal and illegal, rich and poor.” Regrettably, the program was forced to end in 2008 because of lack of funding. Since then Mt. Sinai has taken over the program’s efforts and helped hundreds of Latino workers who, like Hernandez, suffered from hazardous chemical exposure. Though there has been significant research and attention to the effect of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on Central American migration and the militarization of the U.S. – Mexico border, few are aware of the unique and intimate connections Latino migrants have with this tragedy. Just 5 days prior to 9/11 then–President George W. Bush was recorded saying that if they are willing to do a job no one else wants, then we should welcome them. Surely, walking among the dead at Ground Zero was a job few would volunteer to do, yet many migrant workers dug their hands into the remains and wreckage. Without even needing to be said, it was a day of such mourning for all of New York City, and a grief felt twice over by the Latino community. When memorializing the attacks on the World Trade Center, people of color are omitted, as the master narrative, the Eurocentric perspective of colonialism, continues to weave together its whitewashed version of American history: few are aware that Mohawk ironworkers helped construct the original towers and that they later assisted in the clean up of Ground Zero and the construction of One World Trade Center. The media falls silent in recognizing these forgotten heroes. TIME magazine’s 64-page tribute on its 10th anniversary, for instance, pictured not one Black service worker who aided in the rescue efforts on September 11th, though about a dozen lost their lives in this tragedy. And of course, this country cannot hide the blatant anti-Muslim and anti-Middle Eastern sentiment that continues to reverberate across the nation. Year after year on September 11th, New York City commemorates the tragedy with the slogan “Gone but not forgotten.” Yet some who died that day still do not have their names etched into the World Trade Center Memorial and were it not for their friends and family, they would have been forgotten. by Leanne Motylenski        Last week, Fox and Friends criticized Yale for bringing Black Lives Matter leader DeRay Mckesson to campus to speak in a lecture series on “Transformational Leadership” at the Divinity School. Fox “News” pundit Tucker Carlson brought Yale sophomore Aryssa Damron on the show to denounce Mckesson as a “race hustler” and a “hater.” Her comments went viral on Yale social networks and she may never escape them. She was turned into the meat shield behind which Fox could attack Black Lives Matter. Tucker Carlson’s intonation as he “interviews” Damron sounds as if he is prompting a young child to thank some obscure relative for a lackluster birthday gift. To call them loaded questions would be an understatement; to call it journalism would be an insult to the craft. Damron dutifully answers Carlson’s gleeful prods at the civil rights activist. Angry old white people  across America grimace at America’s weakness for giving Mckesson space at Yale. Liberal Yalies indulge their impulse to tear Damron apart on social media (low hanging fruit). And Damron. What did she achieve? She wasn’t taking a stand on conservative values. No denouncing big government for stepping on our rights. She attacked a civil rights activist for five minutes on national television, using thinly-veiled racialized rhetoric and lazy research to judge his lack of “qualifications” to speak at Yale for two days. Fox News targets a Black Lives Matter activist. Liberals shoot back on social media. Fox News gets more views and attention. Business at usual. Business. Fox News makes money off of inflaming partisan and racial differences. They made money off of all the views liberal students gave the clip on their YouTube channel. We clicked the link knowing what it would say, just to indulge our anger toward the “other side.” Damron’s answers are predictable. She says the Divinity School inviting Mckesson makes her “disillusioned with Yale.” She nods and smiles when Carlson calls Mckesson a “hater” and a “race hustler.” She goes on to say that conservative students at Yale are marginalized, citing actually believable instances of students being harassed for wearing conservative paraphernalia. Carlson laments that liberals aren’t quite as open-minded as they pretend to be. He ends by saying, “I really liked having you on. Thank you for doing this, and I really hope it doesn’t bring bad consequences to you when you get back to New Haven.” Without a doubt, he knew exactly what was going to happen. And he loved it. Liberal Yalies got vicious on social media when the video of the interview made it to the “Overheard at Yale” Facebook page. In the interview, Damron says she pays over $60K a year to attend Yale, and expects better. In the comment thread, a peer outs her: she’s a Questbridge scholar—a recipient of a full-ride scholarship for “low-income, high achieving students.” She doesn’t pay $60K to go to Yale. Being a low-income and conservative woman at Yale does truly put her in a marginalized position on Yales campus. Her zeal to speak on national news was just a nail in the coffin. Instead of using Damron’s parents’ income to reveal her hypocrisy or further bludgeon this low-hanging fruit, we have to recognize the ways in which corporate media manipulated all of us. She’s a young person, relatively new to an overwhelming institution in a cosmopolitan city very far geographically and culturally from her home in Ashland, Kentucky, a city that is 95 percent white. She probably inherited many of her political views from her parents. She probably doesn’t understand the Black Lives Matter movement. She doesn’t yet know how to disguise her racism with politically-correct language like her wealthier conservative peers. Going on that show went against her interests. It did nothing for her but surround her with even more conflict and judgment than she already surely faced. Already the first link on Google when you search her name is this inflammatory, racist clip where she is used by rich old men to fuel the fire and boost their sinking ratings. If there’s one way to radicalize someone even further, it’s to exclude them from any world in which they can relate to the other side. As we rewatch the clip and attack Damron, Fox News profits. Aryssa Damron was manipulated, and so were we. She’s the easy target. The systems her words represent, and the hate of Fox News—those are the real enemies. She and I stand on opposite ends of the political spectrum of the campus, both radical in our ideologies and committed to our causes. I know the more she is attacked and excluded, the less she will understand, the more mindlessly she will believe the propaganda of Fox News. So the next time you see her on campus, smile. She hasn’t had the best week. Show her that people committed to social justice, like Mckesson, are not “haters” or “intolerant,” but rather generally good people devoted to helping and—more difficult yet—understanding other people. by Sebastian Medina-Tayac Hear from DeRay Mckessen on October 2nd and 3rd at the Yale Divinity School. 					Sebi, youre great  Keep up the good work brother!        On the evening of Saturday, September 19th, the Yale Film Society (YFS) and the Religion and Social Change Film Series hosted a screening of Spike Lee’s masterpiece biopic Malcolm X at the Whitney Humanities Center (WHC). The beautiful WHC auditorium, paired with the grainy 35mm film, created a powerful atmosphere in which the depiction of Malcolm X’s life as a black activist and Nation of Islam minister was made all the more impactful. Malcolm X is one of several films that will be screened at WHC this semester, and if Saturday’s turnout is any indication of the series’s popularity, the YFS should expect a warm reception for future screenings. Although the auditorium was by no means packed, it was comfortably filled with Yale students and New Haven residents alike, who all arrived early and excited for the 7pm screening. Malcolm X is an incredible film, a masterpiece of cinematography, acting, and directing which brings The Autobiography of Malcolm X, as told by Alex Haley, to life on the big screen. The film’s narrative begins during Malcolm Little’s teenage years and continues through his early encounters with drugs and crime, interlaced with flashbacks spanning his childhood. The film shifts focus once Malcolm is incarcerated and introduced to Baines, a Nation of Islam minister and fellow inmate. Malcolm X, having dropped his last name, rises quickly through the Nation of Islam’s ranks. As he accrues more power, Malcolm X simultaneously garners more disdain and animosity from both white Americans and other ministers within the Nation of Islam, including Baines. Baines is probably the biggest dramatic liberty the film takes; he adds an extra layer of betrayal and intensity, but he is by no means essential to its plot, as he doesn’t exist in the Autobiography (or in real life). The film also tends to distance itself, and noticeably so, from the Nation of Islam’s views and ideas: it very rarely details the Nation’s actual teachings, preferring, for example, to show the idea of a clash between the followings of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. rather than to show discussions within the movement itself. And all of Malcolm X’s speeches shown in the film, regarding the specificities of the Nation, are followed by critiques from skeptics. While this artistic choice can be explained as a lead-in to Malcolm X’s change in views (prior to his assassination), it is likely just an attempt, on the part of the film’s producers, to temper the film’s content. The last section of the film follows Malcolm X’s pilgrimage to Mecca, roughly as it occurred, and stretches out to the end of his life and legacy. On his travels to Mecca, after leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X was astonished by the diversity of Islam and by the interracial love and acceptance the religion fostered. He accordingly changed his views regarding his practice of Islam and leadership within the movement. However, just as he began to preach a more moderate philosophy upon his arrival home, Malcolm X was assassinated. Although the film attempted to convey the inner turmoil that plagued Malcolm X prior to his shift in views, it failed to salvage this striking change which the actual autobiography better illustrated. The film also links Malcolm X’s teachings to modern South African society: images of Soweto protests overlay his eulogy, and Nelson Mandela makes a cameo as a schoolteacher in a South African lesson on Malcolm X. The movie, released in 1992, would have been extremely poignant as the fight against apartheid came to a climax. The movie in its entirety presents its audiences with huge challenges, but the audience on Saturday rose to meet every one. It was a beautiful thing to sit in an auditorium with a sizably black audience and hear everyone sigh in unison at the recognition of Nelson Mandela’s face or the sound of Sam Cooke’s voice, to gasp and laugh and mourn along with the characters. Malcolm X portrays a powerful and critical journey that should resonate now more than ever with the Yale community. During such a contentious time, when Yale is relearning what it means to be a community with common goals, attempting to open up a dialogue regarding the past’s role in its contemporary culture, the story of Malcolm X is an important one to keep in mind. We often need to be reminded that we must remain open minded to readjusting our individual stances, and Malcolm X’s own willingness to do so should be a model to us all. by Eleanor Pritchett  					Ellie has a beautiful soul        On September 13th, 2015, fourteen-year-old Ahmed Mohamed from Irving, Texas effortlessly constructed a digital clock in the span of twenty minutes. For a young NASA fanboy whose passion is to engineer and innovate, this was just another Sunday night. Before going to bed, he placed it in his book bag, eager to share his latest creation with his teachers. The next day, Ahmed showed the clock to a teacher who praised his good work, but also asked him not to show it to anyone else in the school. When the clock’s alarm went off in an English class later that day, Ahmed’s teacher accused him of making and bringing a bomb to school. After being brought to a room within MacArthur High School, he was interrogated by five police officers, then subsequently taken to a juvenile detention center in handcuffs. There, having been denied a phone call to his parents, Ahmed was further questioned and later fingerprinted. As pictures of Ahmed handcuffed circulated the internet, there has been an outpour of public support from people around the world who claim to #standwithAhmed.  Giants like NASA, MIT and Google have offered Ahmed an abundance of internships, scholarships and other attractive opportunities, including an invitation to attend the Google Science Fair, a scholarship to attend Space Camp USA and a personal request from Mark Zuckerberg to visit Facebook headquarters. While generous, these offers and invitations have increasingly become the center of attention which skews our understanding of Ahmed’s experience as a simple suppression of creativity. There is no doubt that Ahmed is gifted, but what was questioned were his motives. Instead of receiving support from his teachersfigures of authority whose job it is to nurture and protect young mindsAhmed was villainized simply because his English teacher doubted his intentions. Failing to disassociate stereotypes from reality, she identified him as harmful. The perception of Ahmed as a threat is magnified by the mingling of his identities as a child of immigrant parents, as a Muslim, and as a Black youth in America. We are not trying to diminish the support Ahmed has received, however, these generous offers must not eclipse the experience of being in a perpetual state of otherness. We cannot allow them to veil the heavy burdens minorities must carry in an attempt to survive in an oppressive and discriminatory system. A system that is reinforced by institutions, run by figures of authority and influenced by rhetoric that conditions us to perceive people in categorical ways. A young Black male must be a trouble maker. A Muslim must be scheming. The child of immigrant parents must be separate from his peers. Politicians have commented on this incident in a manner that further distorts the event’s inherent issues, and fails to hold accountable members of the school administration, law enforcement, or the general conditions in which this injustice was allowed to occur . An opportunity now exists for politicians to initiate a conversation regarding the broken justice system and racialized society we live in. Instead of misdirecting the discourse towards who we allow to succeed, they can and must discuss whose humanity is valued in America.  In a tweet addressed to Ahmed, Hillary Clinton rightly points out that it is fear and assumptions that led to his arrest. Yet, under what conditions will Ahmed and his peers be allowed to remain curious, to move forward, to explore their options when their environments remain static? How are we changing, or rather, how should we change our current society in order to facilitate a safe and accepting atmosphere that we claim America has?  Obama was also quick to overlook the implications of Ahmed’s detention, claiming that it is “kids like Ahmed” that demonstrate what it truly means to be “American.” However, just as much as Ahmed’s sense of innovation is part of America’s spirit, so is the history and legacy of racism, anti-blackness, Islamophobia, surveillance, and dehumanization of minorities. The nation takes ownership over the creativity and accomplishments of its citizens, but refuses to acknowledge its discriminatory practices. It is important to #standwithAhmed, as all of the tweets and shared Facebook posts provide solidarity and support for Ahmed and his family, as well as highlight the gravity of his experience. But the frustration expressed towards the English teacher and police officers involved should be redirected towards what they represent. Moving forward entails having proactive conversations that link small incidents to larger issues in a nod towards the manifestations of racism. Whether you are President Obama or a first year in Pierson, you can engage with Ahmed’s story more fully by considering just how deeply racism and Islamophobia permeate daily experiences. This is vital because this is not the end. Discrimination will continue to happen, but not everyone can have a hashtag and not everyone will gain national attention. We ought to use Ahmed’s unfortunate experience to understand these occurrences on a broader scale. Treating prejudice as isolated to specific regions in America fails to address the complexities of racism and Islamophobia. The real danger lies in allowing historical amnesia to take place, thereby decontextualizing events from social and political realities. Letting go of this tunnel vision requires self education, effort, and a comprehension of history. Understanding the systems that lead to dehumanization of others requires time, it requires knowing that even if you don’t have the answers now, you are willing to look for them. Systemic discrimination manifests itself throughout people of colors lives and serves to make them feel less human. It begins the moment we are coded as different. Ahmed’s experience of being classified began long before his arrestin an interview he reflects on middle school memories of being called “bombmaker” and “terrorist.” The evolution of bigotry from taunting name calling to a law enforced reality often occurs because prejudice is an ubiquitous presence in people’s lives. Those committed to social justice must be conscientious of this trajectory. We should be present and intervene during incidents of discrimination that occur at a smaller scale. While these instances can easily be brushed off as off-hand jokes or harmless missteps, they accumulate to demean, alienate and ultimately dehumanize people on the receiving end. Like the president, we want to live in an America that is greatone that is pushed forward by innovation and truly welcomes diversity. But we will not be able to do so until we as a nation acknowledge how deeply implicated we all are in making Muslims, Blacks, Immigrants and other minorities feel inferior. by Ishrat Mannan and Daad Sharfi        I saw Straight Outta Compton the day before I arrived on campus. Because of the sensationalist nature of social media, I had already been barraged with a plethora of opinions supporting and denigrating the film. Perhaps I entered the theater already biased. Nevertheless, when all was said and done, I left with conflicting emotions. I respect N.W.A. as a pivotal music group that reflected the sentiments of an oppressed people and I recognize their biopic as a culturally important piece of Black art. However, I am not about to forgive the misrepresentation (and the blatant disrespect that comes along with that misrepresentation) of certain characters. Why is Dr. Dre made out to be the victim in all of his relationships with women, knowing full well the exact opposite  is true? Where are the narratives of all the women Eazy E unintentionally put at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS? Why is almost every woman in the film topless or an embodiment of the “Angry Black Woman” stereotype? The only supportive women  Ice Cube and Eazy E’s partners  were in, at most, three scenes each. “Misogynoir” was a term coined by a queer Black woman Moya Bailey in an attempt “to describe the particular brand of hatred directed at Black women in American visual and popular culture. I think it’s important to analyze the overall Black experience and the Black female experience separately, especially in the realm of popular culture. Eazy E isnt the only person who has rubbed up against the body a bodacious Black woman for the purpose of getting attention. Lest we forget Lily Allen , Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, and countless other white female artists fetishizing and degrading the bodies voluptuous Black women. Given the exclusion we have faced in mass media, the erasure in communities of color and on college campuses, the respectability politics (i.e. we are encouraged to dress a certain way, talk a certain way, behave a certain way in order to be taken seriously)  flung at us from all sides and the immeasurable amount of unadulterated bullshit we are forced to swallow on a daily basis, I feel compelled to insert my Black girl opinion. In light of recent so-called “discussions” about rap and misogyny between students Aaron Sibarium and Yonas Takele I feel both flattered and offended that there is an entire conversation about me and my community happening without me. Black feminist critique is either taken for granted or completely overshadowed. We are reduced to “Angry Black Women” by our male counterparts; dismissed for “just mouthing off for the sake of hearing ourselves talk.” Spoken word poet Porscha Olayiwola makes this very clear in her poem “Rekia Boyd” when she poses the question: “how tight does my noose have to wring?” Why do we only care about black girls when they are tragic or dead? As a girl who has a very tumultuous history with hip-hop culture, I am tired of  the white gaze being cast on Black issues. Hip-hop was born from a people who did not have the highest degree of formal education and did not reap the benefits afforded by racial or socioeconomic privilege. Through our desire to express the reality of our lives, we were able to create this artistry that resonates throughout all cultures. Rap, though not removed from sexist lyrics, speaks to a greater injustice perceived by the Black community. It addresses the lack of opportunity in many communities of color, and the grisly results of that inequity. And guess what? There are female rappers who speak out vocally about sexism in the music industry: Salt n Pepa, Nicki Minaj, Missy Elliot and Lauryn Hill are just a few names that immediately pop into my mind. So, to respond to Mr. Sibarium, I am not down with white men getting praise for the work Black women have done and continue to do, nor am I amused by your attempt at a pithy tag line. My advice would be the following: Don’t insult our art and stay in your lane. That being said, Mr. Takele, I am not down with Black men assuming they can speak for us. Y’all have got some slack to pick up. Stop silencing us. Check your privilege. Recognize this one Black girl’s soft shout. by Ashia Ajani  					Your words are powerful and unstoppable. Speak the truth and those who disagree can live within their lies!        At precisely seven o’clock Sunday night, the disembodied head of instructor Nicholas Charleston peers out from the screen at eight expectant students. Skype carries his voice from Oklahoma. Of those in attendance, six sit behind thick copies of A Dictionary of the Choctaw Language. Nearly all are Choctaw themselves. Dr. Angela Gleason, director of the Center for Language Study (CLS), sits on the left and to the front, supervising. So begins the first of a pilot series of Choctaw language classes to be offered every Sunday and Tuesday at Yale’s Native American Cultural Center (NACC). The initiative is one of the faces of Yale’s new Native American Language Project, a four-year collaboration between the NACC, CLS, and the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage. As the designated instructor, Charleston is young but hardly new; he has been involved in teaching, curricular development, and efforts to preserve the Choctaw language for over six years, including a stint tutoring two Yale students through the CLS Directed Independent Language Study (DILS) program last year. In 2011, he was among the first students to complete a Choctaw Language and Culture minor at Southeastern Oklahoma State. Tonight, he smiles enthusiastically as he learns our names. We begin. The language of the Choctaw Nation comprehends multiple dialects and spans many states. It is the ancestral tongue of natives to the Southeast later deracinated and resettled in modern-day Oklahoma. It is written using Roman letters. Its cadence is fluid, its vowels and consonants either short or sustained, but never sharp. As far as pedagogy goes, Charleston promises to emphasize conversational proficiency at the outset of class. He spotlights his two former tutees, quizzing them playfully, then grins. “I like roasting my students,” he says. Periodically, he pauses to offer up an anthropological annotation. “This is the Oklahoma dialect,” he explains. Or, “This is the contraction people use in Mississippi.” He becomes even more animated as he combines two of our new words into the name Tvshka Lusa, meaning “black warrior.” As a child, Charleston pictured this man as a muscular, dark-skinned superhero. As a historical figure, Tvshka Lusa died fighting in a bloody battle opposite Hernando de Soto in 1540. Both the makeup of the class and the professional yet intimate style of instruction reveal that for those present, this opportunity is a matter of deep personal significance and not mere sanitized intellectual curiosity. After class, I catch up with Tanner Allread, TC ’16, one of the pair of students to study with Charleston last year. He is a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and a few generations removed from any kind of fluency. “You can still be a part of your culture and connected to it if you don’t speak the language,” he concedes, “but if you can, it’s important.” Another Choctaw classmate, David Rico, BR ’16 goes as far as to identify a moral imperative. “If you’re an academic, and you’re native, and you have the means but don’t learn your language, then you’re not as radical and down as you should be,” he declares. I wouldn’t disagree. For now, the eight of us have been entrusted with a lengthy vocabulary list. My tongue trips over the sounds. My mind races to find points of reference—a French nasal sound, a Persian sentence structure. What started as my first journalistic assignment has turned into—an adventure, let’s say. Not really a voyage of discovery. Join us! Why not? Classes run for one hour, 7-8pm on Sundays and Tuesdays at 26 High Street, first door on the right. by Alejandra Padin-Dujon         Can white people feel proud of being white? In the Silliman College MOSAIC Camp Yale activity, students had to move to a poster with a phrase or word that resonated most with the statement made.  These statements were supposed to cover a range of experiences that impacted students at Yale. Whenever race was discussed, most white students avoided the Race poster and gathered at the Ability poster. Even within the white community certain peers felt alienated. “I am white, but I didn’t fit the typical white stereotype at Yale,” Chloe Zimmerman DP ’19.  Even within the white community, white privilege only exists if you meet the proper criteria. People of color felt especially alienated during the MOSAIC activity.  Some students felt that the activity tried to categorize them into a certain label. “I will not be your token minority,” Mairead Brennan PC ’19.  Another student added,“I felt uncomfortable during the MOSAIC activity.  I felt like the token poor student,” Patrick Hong CC ‘19. At the time it is important to note that some students did not feel like many of the statements resonated with them.  “Yale has a history of being a place where white people who are economically advantaged are able to express themselves more freely, but it is important to recognize that students struggle with a variety of issues such as abusive families, self-identity crises, family addiction, and these struggles do not fit into the buzzwords that were prevalent in the Silliman exercise.  I do not know if we could have delved in more, but there were certain issues that were excluded from the typical buzzwords,” Marie Claire, SM ’19. Other students felt saddened and angered by the results of MOSAIC.  “I cried during the MOSAIC activity. I cried when I saw the majority of girls move when sexual harassment was mentioned.  I wanted to punch the assholes who were on their phones during the activity when sexual assault is such an important issue that needs to be discussed,” Elaine Lou, DC ‘19. The goal of MOSAIC was a complicated one,  as Linette Rivera JE ‘19 commented, “I feel like they wanted to show how we are similar to our peers in the sense that there will always be someone there that is living through the same question.  At the same time, many of us became painfully aware of how much of a minority we really are.” It is difficult to say what a person should take away from MOSAIC,  but I can I tell you what I took away:  I understand that no one is perfect and that we are all troubled about some aspect of our lives, whether it be race, socioeconomic standing, sexuality, self-identity, family relations, and the list goes on.  At the same time, I understand that I am not alone.  It is often easy to overlook this common truth and isolate yourself but you shouldn’t.  There are other people who share the exact same struggles and even though the MOSAIC activity was poorly executed, it still reminded me that I don’t have to face them alone. by Arturo Pineda        Each time that I hear a Yale student use the word “ratchet, I die a little on the inside. They’re appropriating a word that has a specific and serious cultural context in Louisiana, where I’m from. The first time most Louisiana natives hear the word ratchet is not in a frat house, but in their homes. Our mothers use the word to discipline us—to say that what we are doing is wrong and will get us in trouble. They say it because they care. In its most popular usage, the word “ratchet” is used to demean Black women by associating us with trashy behavior. But ratchetry was coined by women of color to correct and ultimately uplift their daughters. When my mother called me ratchet for the first time, I was not laughing. It was a slash to my ego, a check to my behavior. Ratchet is a word that I constantly hear people at Yale use to make jokes about their troubling situations. It is very confusing for me to hear someone call themselves ratchet because my first instinct is to help them. As a native Louisianan, it is very weird to hear someone acknowledge their own ratchet behavior through giggles. The second place we Louisianans heard the word ratchet was with the debut of Baton Rouge rapper Lil’ Boosie’s hit Do the Ratchet, a song and accompanying dance that allowed our generation to grapple with the term and the strict upbringing that accompanied it. On one hand, this song and dance allowed us to celebrate our “inner ratchet” in a different way. On the other hand, this song was the first instance where ratchet was sensationalized and ironically used to publicly shame Black women. Ratchet is a word that has been a part of my vocabulary since I was very young. However, its meaning has changed since leaving Louisiana, and I no longer feel comfortable using it because it has become racialized – like it’s the new way to call something “ghetto.” Words like ghetto have a complicated usage history because everyone who uses ghetto knows that it’s really no fun being ghetto. Ratchet is used by Yalies in the same vein, and that offends me. I would like to thrive in an environment where I can use the word ratchet the way I grew up using it, the way that it was meant to be used, and not feel like I am being misunderstood. White people misuse the word ratchet, but I am not talking to white people. I am talking to the people of color at Yale who throw the word around so carelessly. They have a moral stake in being respectful of my culture. Either stop appropriating ratchet or try and use it correctly. Ratchet can do so much for Yalies if we understand how to use it. Calling each other ratchet is a practice that should be done out of love—an effort to solidify our relationships to others. by Karléh Wilson 					I love how you speak your mind and stand up for what you believe in. It is inspiring. You share your feelings and beliefs always respectfully and graciously. I respect you and look up to you for that. Never change girl.        by Alexis Payne The Sapphire. The Mammy. The Jezebel. The Sapphire. The Mammy. The Jezebel….The media, like a broken record, plays this same, sad song again and again. It seems these are the only identities available for Black girls in America. In an industry dominated by white executives, white producers, and white writers, narratives that strive to embody all of “Blackness” are few and far between. Instead, it is often easier for production companies to support narratives that perpetuate common stereotypes, giving Black women few options to shape their own identities for public consumption. Awkward Black Girl represents a revolutionary and much-needed interruption of this cycle. Issa Rae, who is both the writer and the main character of her hit web series, is no Jezebel, Sapphire or Mammy. She is a human being whose very existence at the forefront of pop culture and media rejects the theories of Black essentialism. She pushes the envelope by suggesting that Blackness can mean a range of different experiences and by emphasizing through her work that there is no one way to be Black. In a new documentary highlighting the importance of the show, Shana Redmond, a professor at the University of California remarked, “We’re so unaccustomed to seeing Black folks as anything other than the life of the party, the dancer, the extrovert…she [Issa Rae] is really bringing some complicated narratives to bear on those types of representations.” I first watched Awkward Black Girl a few months ago because my friends  all of whom identify proudly as “awkward Black girls”  told me how revolutionary it was. I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did nor did I expect to relate to Rae’s character as much as I did. At moments I found myself crying at the fact that I had become so numb to the influence of mass media. I had been unknowingly indoctrinated to believe that because of my own deviation from the “common narrative,” I was “other than Black.” I saw myself in Awkward Black Girl: painfully introverted, beautifully quirky, and uncoordinated. Constantly grappling with what it means to be a Black woman in life and love, I was enamored with the range of identities in the show, the unapologetic and seamless integration of “key issues” into the main narrative, and the ability the show had to make me laugh harder than I ever have before. If nothing more, Awkward Black Girl has been revolutionary as a narrative that allows Black people to laugh. It has countered the images we have seen every day about Black violence, murder, and systematic oppression. It has put Black girls at the forefront of their own stories (in their rightful place) and it has removed white producers from their self-righteous pedestals by insisting that the experience of Blackness cannot be accurately depicted without the presence of Black people in the industry. There is no doubt about it. There is a pressing need for more shows that elevate the true narratives of Black girls everywhere. Reflecting the sentiments of Viola Davis’s victory speech, “You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Thanks to the work of brilliant women like Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay, and Shonda Rhimes, we have been thrust into a more hopeful era when it comes to the portrayal of Black women in mass media. Nonetheless, we have a long way to go in order to promote awareness of the beautiful diversity of Black Womanhood. 					Well written  enjoy the view that was expressed.        by Eleanor Pritchett  The little pink magic marker in my hand seems too light for the heaviness of the task in front of me. Draw a moment when you’ve felt unsafe. Suddenly I can’t think. This room in the New Haven Public Library full of young queer and trans* New Haveners is such a safe space—where are the unsafe spaces? I have to fight to remember sometime this month when I, a queer woman of color, felt unsafe. That’s the power of the New Haven LGBTQ+ Youth Kickback, and of the LGBTQ+ Speak Out (#SpeakforYrself). These are the necessities that queer and trans* youth lack most disproportionately. You’ll hear these words repeated constantly in queer activist spaces, and Kickback is here to give them the space to come to the forefront. In a moment, one of the chief organizers will take the stage and introduce themselves and the rest of the organizers, but for now the room is abuzz with recognition and curiosity. “I’m so happy to see you!” muffled through the barrier of a tight hug; introductions between seatmates and reunions of old acquaintances. Under every seat is a small square of posterboard, a marker, and a triangle of construction paper, which we will use later to create a big collaborative art piece with the People’s Arts Collective of New Haven about our own experiences. There are two boards on the stage: one says “WELCOME!” in big, happy letters and lists the schedule for the 2 hour event: introductions, feature stories, Art Part, and, of course, stories by the youth of the audience. The other says the themes of the day in thick black bubble letters over pastel drawings of happy smiling faces over a pastel-colored background reminiscent of a cityscape: Isabel, a queer woman from New Haven, told of her experience regarding safety in the city. “Where in New Haven can I feel safe?” she asked the crowd, explaining that she felt both unsafe in the city and at war with her own self. “The silence that I learned was my own form of unsafety,” she said. “I am white, privileged,” she told the audience. “I can’t imagine what it would be like as a trans kid of color.” Next, Zoe told a story about her experience with homelessness in the city of New Haven. She’s tall, with a solid presence, but in telling about having to get herself out of a home in which she was told, in her words, “We don’t want you here,” she suddenly looks small. “I left, and I had nowhere to go,” she says. When it was warm, she says, she slept outside behind a school. When it was cold, “I saw someone who looked decent, made friends, got drunk and manipulated the situation.” “Why aren’t there places for queer youth shelters?” she wanted to know. Another youth, Flavio, who asked that everyone refer to them with the gender-neutral pronouns they/them/theirs, told a story about jobs. In their experience, and in the experience of their parents who don’t speak English: “I am the only gateway for them to get their basic necessities,” they said. They pulled the chair off the stage so they could sit on our level. They sat legs crossed, long hair falling into their eyes. Their story is an appeal, a plea. “They’re reducing somebody to a body, to the actions they perform,” Flavio nearly spit out. No one ever thinks of speaking out of turn here; applause is kind and enthusiastic. After the centerpiece stories and the break to draw and reflect, the floor was opened up for anyone in the room to come up and talk about their experiences, with priority given to the young. More than half a dozen young people, most of whom attend weekly Kickback meetings where they work on opening up about their lives, shared some of their most personal stories. Even Zoe remarked that before working on the speak out and even halfway into planning it she felt self-conscious about sharing: “I don’t know if I have relevant experiences,” she remembers thinking, though, of course, she did. The speakers told their stories about being homeless, about coming out to unwelcoming loved ones, about being queer in the military, about needing work, about feeling alone, and about feeling hopeless, and although these stories were truly heartbreaking, one sentiment rang true throughout all of them: Kickback makes the speakers feel safe. “It’s hard for me to imagine someone who doesn’t want to do this work,” Zoe says. “It’s important for me, my wellbeing, and my life.” “The way things are is not enough,” Isabel said succinctly. And, of course, it’s true: there are more than 400 self-identified homeless youth in New Haven right now, and there are, as was estimated during the speak out, maybe twenty beds for them at shelters. A new and much-praised community center, The Escape, has a shelter called The Situation, which boasts fifteen beds for boys 13  24 years old and no current resources for LGBTQ+ boys or beds for girls of any kind. These are issues which dramatically affect the city of New Haven, and which dramatically affect its LGBTQ+ youth—and, as always, these are issues in which Yale students must make their influence count. If we don’t use our privilege as an amplifier for those voices without, we use it as a stage on which to stand above them. Kickback meets Mondays from 3:30- 6pm at the People’s Arts Collective of New Haven as a “weekly hangout space for New Haven queer youth.” Find them on Facebook as Lgbtq+ Youth Kickback or on Tumblr as lgbtqyouthkickback.tumblr.com.        by Sonny Stephens Forty-three desks covered Cross Campus on Saturday in recognition of the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of 43 Mexican students of the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College. A candlelit vigil was held that evening, where Yalies stood in solidarity with the disappeared students and called for what organizers described as “memory, truth, and justice for the Missing 43.” The vigil was the culminating part of a larger-scale event called “Un Año Despues, Ayotzivive” whose goal is to educate students about the incident, call out the Mexican government on its corruption, and address the role U.S. policy plays in the lives of the Mexican people. It began with a discussion at La Casa Cultural with Professor Michael Reed-Hurtado, a Colombian-American lawyer and journalist. Attendees watched a Vice News documentary about the event, and then listened to Hurtado gave his take on the incident as he answered questions. “This is undoubtedly a crime of state, and it needs to be investigated as a crime of state,” said Hurtado. “For the victims, it is not sufficient to get the material killers. It is absolutely fundamental to get the answer as to why: why my sons and who ordered [the attack?]” Following the discussion, the group of listeners marched to the desks at Cross Campus, candles in hand. When they met the crowd at the memorial, they lit more candles and listened to various speakers. Alina Aksiyote, BK ’16, delivered the opening words: “This is not an isolated incident,” Aksiyote said. “There are disappearances everyday in Mexico.” The event also featured an opening and closing song by Blue Feather Drum Group, Yale’s American Indian performance group. In solidarity with the students, Blue Feather performed to contribute to the strong sense of intersectionality at the vigil. Besides demanding answers from the Mexican government, speakers at the event also criticized the United States’ ineffective and passive role in cracking down on violence and corruption in Mexico, citing the problems the U.S. has created by militarizing the conflict. “I’m ashamed of the violence the U.S. has been sponsoring in Latin America for decades. Considering that the United States has provided the Mexican government with $2.3 billion in security assistance as part of the Merida Initiative – a multi-billion dollar aid package to train and equip Mexican security forces to fight, investigate, and prosecute narcotraffickers – the ‘Mexican Drug War’ is actually a huge misnomer.” Caroline Kuritzkes, ES ’18 said. “The Department of State, Department of Defense, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the CIA are deeply entrenched in Ayotzinapa and the hundreds of other cases that have vanished from historical record.” The event ended with a final chant, and the pase de lista, or roll call, of the 43 students. During the roll call, students placed candles at each desk for the missing students, in a powerful and emotional conclusion of the vigil. While Yale may be thousands of miles away from Mexico, this memorial helped students realize that todos somos Ayotzinapa.        by Arturo Pineda “I want to research the emergence of female Latina lawyers in the United Sates during the mid-20th century,” I said to Professor Rohit during office hours for his class on Lawyers as Rebels. I didn’t know how he would react. He responded by saying, “That’s great!” I let out a sigh of relief as he began to rattle off various prominent Latina female lawyers. He asked me dozens of questions about my interest in the subject, personal idols, the importance of race in law, and racial trends in the law. He even mentioned that the National Hispanic Bar Association (NHBA) had a branch in New York. After I left office hours, I felt liberated in the sense that I could explore something personal and relatable to my identity as a Latino. I realized that I didn’t have to continue to learn about a prominent white lawyer; I could learn about an equally prominent Latino lawyer because it interested me. Later that night at 1AM, I received an email with a long list of prominent female Latina lawyers. It was from Professor Rohit. He wanted to make sure I had enough people to research and mentioned that he had talked to my Master and Dean about funding a trip to New York so I could visit the NHBA branch in New York and continue my research there. I was thrilled to read the news. He wasn’t just encouraging me to explore race; he was facilitating the process. As I skimmed through the links he sent me, I realized that I understood the people I was reading about. I understood them on a personal level because I could relate to them so easily. This was the research I wanted to carry out, and I was doing it. Too often, professors try to suppress identity conversations in academic work, but racial identity matters. It has molded my identity, my outlooks, and my academic interests. Because race is an integral part of my character it should not be separated from the college education; rather, it should be welcomingly integrated into the curriculum so that we can better meet the demands of students of color.        by Sonny Stephens and Fernando Torres  When Fetty Wap released “Trap Queen” we were introduced to an amazing artist with a unique look and artistry. “Trap Queen” captures the essence of popular rap with unique lyrics, clever references, and distinctive vocals. Fetty Wap’s breakthrough song quickly rose to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two this May. The single was praised for its infectious lyrics and catchy hooks. It was a distinct departure from the stereotypical love song. “679” and “My Way” soon followed and were met with similar enthusiasm and acclaim. The songs peaked at numbers six and seven, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100. Fetty Wap even claims “679” to be his best song so far. Frankly, we would have to agree. Unfortunately for Fetty Wap, his self-titled album definitely did not fulfill the high hopes that we carried for such an amazing artist; someone who we consider to be one of the most relevant rappers of today. While others might argue that his album triumphantly showcases his skills, we found it to be a major let-down. The album starts off with Fetty’s most iconic song, “Trap Queen,” which was a smart move. It got the listener hyped for the rest of his album. As we continued to listen to Fetty Wap, we noticed that there was a striking lack of progression or variety among the songs.  What started off as a fun club album eventually fell into the realm of snooze-town. One of the last songs on the album, “Rewind,” is a fitting title because at that point in the album that’s all listeners want to do  go back to the upbeat bangers at the beginning. While “679” is perfect for getting the party started, Wap’s other songs are better suited for a night of relaxation. We were hoping that the next song would greet us with the bumping tune characteristic of “Trap Queen,” but instead we were met with mid-tempos and painfully slow songs. The recycled melodies, vocal progressions, and ad-libs had lost our attention by the end of the album. By the end, it was evident that Fetty Wap is a one-trick pony. “Trap Queen,” “679,” and “My Way” are amazing tracks, and songs that we are more than willing to put on replay for hours. However, as far as variety in skill goes, it seems that Fetty Wap is no jack of all trades. &nbsp;        by Nicole Chavez  At the Asian American Cultural Center (AACC) Welcome Reception last Thursday, music and students flowed out of the wooden doors of 295 Crown Street. Balancing their teetering paper plates piled with Asian cuisine, the students who call this old house home talk animatedly with friends. An hour into the event, after everyone had settled down with food and friends, a growing crowd squeezed into the first floor common room, vying for a good spot to watch and listen to Sur et Veritaal, the South Asian a capella group whose name translates as “Melody and [True] Rhythm.” Their Bollywood tune transitioned smoothly into a hot rendition of Sean Paul’s “Fire Burning on the Dance Floor.” Then the Polynesian dance group, Shaka, performed a hula rendition of Beyonce’s “Flawless.” Celebrating their return to the 34-year-old AACC, students demonstrated their ability to integrate their specific cultural traditions into the contemporary and highly diverse Asian American community at Yale. AACC Director Saveena Dhall said the house allows students from increasingly diverse backgrounds to embrace their identities and learn about those of their peers, contributing to a “New Yale,” in which a multicultural experience is valued. Sharon Phu ’19, noted her surprise upon seeing the large and vocal Asian American community at Yale during Bulldog Days. “It’s easy to push it outside of your mind,” she said, referring to student’s ability to actively partake in Asian and Asian American affiliated groups, whether they be affinity-, performance-, or politically-based. Despite these temptations, the Class of 2019 seems eager to take part in the Asian American community at Yale. Meng Fei Shen ’19, for instance, has already gone on a day trip to New York City with several of the AACC Peer Liaisons (upperclassmen mentors hired by the dean’s office) who taught her and other Asian American Yalies about the various Asian American niches embedded in the city. On campus, something as simple as food can help fill the void when feeling homesick and estranged from one’s culture, Phu said. “The food reminds me of home,” she said, referring to the food that the AACC provides at many of their social events. Other students, such as Dennis Vu ’19 and Diana Sharkey ’19, attributed the appeal of the AACC to the flexibility and openness of this social space. For Sharkey, “one of the most incredible things about the AACC – and any of the other cultural centers, for that matter – is their innate openness.” The house serves as a space “to socialize, to participate in various events and meaningful activities, and to just have fun.” What makes the AACC valuable to specific groups such as people of color, as Vu ’19 points out, is that it is “a social space that I can enter without feeling awkwardly out of place or pressured.” In addition to providing what many would refer to as a “safe space” for marginalized groups on campus, the AACC is also “a brave space for students on campus,” according to Dhall. Students who want to grapple with the issues and politics of identities, especially of marginalized groups on campus and in society, can find a home at the AACC as well. In recent years, the Asian American community at Yale has been mobilizing to promote advocacy and initiate reform on several issues, including, but not limited to demystifying the ‘model minority’ and creating an Asian American Studies major at Yale. Dhall credited the Asian American Studies Task Force as a “reenergized force and dedication to scholarship to make sure that the narrative of Asian Americans is in the Yale curriculum.” Some students, like Elaine To ’19, are concerned with the ways in which racialized stereotypes are leading to the self-policing of Asian Americans. Referring to last week’s discussion at St. Anthony’s Hall on “The Myth of the Model Minority,” To said, “one difficulty Asian Americans, especially younger generations, are facing now is working to rise above our ‘model minority’ status and not let ourselves be restricted by those stereotypes.” Towards the closing of the Welcome Reception, people slowly trickled out of the center, seemingly reluctant to leave the energetic and warm space. Some students meandered to one of the several sticky note boards positioned throughout the center. On these boards, students were encouraged to answer the prompts written on them. One prompt asked, “What are you most looking forward to [at the AACC] this year?” Written in bubbly letters on an orange stick note, one student had responded, “Building a community.”        by Arianna B. Neal “This is not a trickle. This is a hemorrhage,” stated Professor Jafari Allen. Within his office, the floating scents of green mint tea and burning incense intermingled with the soft tones of classical piano and clinking glass dishes. He explained the crisis. Over the past few months, three renowned faculty of color have announced their departures from Yale University’s already small African American Studies department. Among those departing is African American Studies and Anthropology Professor Jafari Allen. What exactly is the reason behind this influx of departures?  Some report that it is due, in part, to departmental issues with the award of tenure. Others argue that it is due to the attraction to more stable job security at competing institutions. Others attribute these departures simply to coincidence and personal choice. Professor Allen begs to differ. When asked about what progress Yale University has made on its journey towards becoming a more self aware and socially conscious environment, Professor Allen’s first response was that he is saddened by what he has seen. “What I’ve seen in the last few years is a lack of commitment on the part of the upper administration…[and] by commitment I mean commitment to funding, [and] I mean commitment to sustained programming and not just Sex Week or Queer Week or hiring somebody who you expect to leave right away. I mean actual engagement with the work.” While Professor Allen is making what may seem to be an overly serious indictment of Yale’s lack of commitment to diversity, there is a long history of faculty of color prematurely leaving Yale that supports his claim. Professor Allen continues, “People think that there’s a problem around this most glittery jewel of Yale, … Elizabeth Alexander, leaving [and that that is] simply something that is inevitable. Vanessa and I leaving is just something that’s ‘oh that’s too bad but kind of accepted.” Yet, he continued, this trend is limited to neither Elizabeth Alexander, nor the African American Studies department, nor the past few months. If one looks back only three years, one sees the departures of formerly tenured Kamari Clarke, Marcus Hunter, and Sean Brotherton, whom the upper administration “made no real attempt to keep.” So, when Professor Allen came to Yale, he understood exactly where he was going: “one of the most ancient of the ancient eight and a place that was steeped in a particular tradition.” He also came to understand that there were two Yales. “One is Old Yale, and… that is lodged in… the most conservative of [traditional] disciplines [where] we could draw charts about … who and what is left out of [focus].” Yet, Professor Allen continues, “There is another Yale, and that is a Yale of interdisciplinary work and of African-American Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Ethnicity, Race, and Migration, burgeoning indigenous studies and soon to be Asian and Asian American Studies, and these are places where if you were to draw a chart … you’d see… the site of what people call diversity.” “New Yale is also about new ideas,” Professor Allen continues, “The commitment in those newer disciplines is about making an intervention. What I’ve seen over the last several years since my honeymoon phase is … a disdain for the people who are doing that work.” And this new Yale is in danger of losing the faculty members that are its foundation. So, what can we do? “Organize, organize, organize,” Professor Allen said without hesitation. “Now that there’s this conversation about symbols, this is a good time, while people want to skirt around the edges of the real issues of white supremacy, that students demand and model talking about it forthrightly.” Are we up to the challenge?        by Alejandra Padin-Dujon Sprague Hall is comfortably full—occupied, not packed. The pretty, cream-colored woodwork glows in the light of soft yellow lamps. All goes quiet as the lights dim, all sound replaced by the false calm of an audience pretending to be ready. The opening remarks are trivial. They end. Keynote speaker Hilton Als is a decorated theater critic, and he looks like a great titan of a man when he lumbers onstage, back bent and footsteps dramatically wide. “Call me your nigger Proust.” Fuck! That’s his opening line. His words are exquisite and brutal. First he talks about bodies. There are the female ones he grew up with—featureless. Moving on. There’s the sad Black one he tried to shed, and the queer one “electric with its own presence” that he was so hopeful and so eager to inhabit. In his younger days, he once constructed a mythical monolithic Gay Body by superimposing pain on archetypes of dreams of wearing a New York City rainbow, but it broke. Als begins to talk about AIDS and never stops. His poetic descriptions populate gay bars in the East Village with a gay White aristocracy. These people are meticulously careless, and self-consciously masculine, and they embrace Foucault and Jungle Fever in equal, complementary measures. Fuck! Hilton Als is hard to hear because he is too easy to feel. He is hard to feel because the ringing timbre of all he says he doesn’t want to remember bludgeons me senseless. The hardest thing to process that he shares is called the “ecstasy of degradation,” because it is the sound of gay blackness selling itself into slavery on the pages of a Fuck Buddy Wanted ad. At least Als tells us about the lovers. Carlos is a Botero-esque figure with curly hair and a ready tongue. He’s such a charmer that he scores even with skinny white boys from the bars—you know, the type that gets off on fucking a secret. Als’ hollow voice ricochets off the walls as he narrates this, and I can almost hear Carlos laugh. And then there’s Alvin the Bouncer. He has a cock like an erect fairytale. It’s nice, because he finds love with Carlos before he finds AIDS. A few incantations later, and Als is finished. He ends with, “Sing, bitch! because it’s all we ever had, in all those moments of remembering and not remembering alike.” Then a ghost-white Peter Salovey steps onstage to present the Windham Campbell prizes, and the Earth shifts back to a brighter, more cynical axis. I want to laugh. When I get my bearings, I’m startled by so many white faces. In a fit of rueful absurdity I think, If Mattel made college presidents…        by Taylor Jackson   Many Tumblr posts have been written about the cosplay struggle for comic enthusiasts of color. There’s the constant dilemma of either wanting to cosplay your favorite character, who probably looks nothing like you, or wanting to go as a character who looks more like you, but knowing that you will be competing with just about every other POC in attendance for the best costume. Some fans of color just resort to heroes who wear masks or have unearthly skin tones. This cosplay struggle is very telling of the greater struggle for representation for POC in media. Take the Miles Morales debate. Miles Morales is a Black Latino Brooklyn native who becomes Spiderman after the death of Peter Parker. Even though Morales is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel Ultimate Universe, the idea of a Black Spiderman on screen had many fans up in arms. While some fans were ecstatic that Morales would finally be on screen, many others were upset at Marvel’s attempts to“force” POC into “untraditional” roles. The reality of the Marvel and DC Universes is that the vast majority of superheroes fall neatly into the categories of white, male, and heterosexual. When Sony’s database was hacked in 2014, the Marvel requirements for Spiderman were revealed to be: (1) male and (2) “not a homosexual.” While Morales’s portrayal in film subverts the specified racial barrier, his sexuality is yet to be determined. The history of superhero comics alludes to a preference for white, male protagonists. In fact, many of our most popular heroes originated as WWII propaganda, such as Captain America, the United State’s golden haired golden boy. The first Captain America comic came out in 1941, when America was entrenched in both WWII and racial segregation. It wasn’t until 1969 that Marvel’s first black hero, Black Panther, appeared on the pages of its comics. Hailing from the fictional nation of Wakanda, Black Panther appears in many different Marvel series, from the old Captain America comics, to his very own comic series. And over the past few years, Marvel has been pushing to increase the presence of POC in their collection of heroes. Miles Morales is now being accompanied by Kamala Khan, a young Pakistani-American woman living in Jersey City, whose Muslim identity is a formative part of her hero’s arc and informs her sense of justice. In an NPR interview, Brian Michael Bendis, Morales’s creator, quotes Spiderman in saying that with great power comes great responsibility,” and he now feels it is his responsibility to create work that is representative of the world he and his kids are living in. Whether the Marvel Cinematic Universe will adopt Bendis’s attitude, however, is still unclear.        by Ashia Ajani and Nicole Chavez  This past Wednesday, Jenn Fang, an Asian-American post-doctoral student, spoke to a diverse crowd of Yale students regarding the myth of the “Model Minority.” As explained by Fang, The idea of “successful” minorities and “problem” minorities came as a direct response to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and 70s. The ideology developed as Japanese-Americans were successfully working their way up the income ladder. White observers began to wonder: “If Asian-Americans were able to overcome post-war discrimination and racism, what was wrong with other minorities?” In relation to this dynamic, Fang discussed the work of Jennifer Lee, Professor at the Sociology School of Social Sciences at UC Irvine. Lee describes this stereotype as having “limited benefits.” It can begin as a stepping stool, but ultimately becomes a hindrance. Fang went on to explain that.contrary to popular belief, the myth of the “Model Minority” did not to applaud  Asian Americans. The intent was to disparage other minorities. Fang also explained how the term “Asian American,” which encompasses many ethnicities, homogenizes the experiences of people of Asian descent when the experiences of these different groups should not be lumped together. Perhaps the worst part of the model minority myth is the fact that it completely diminishes other issues affecting Asian-American communities. Hate crimes, depression, suicide, and lack of sexual health conversations are just a few examples. Many young Asian Americans are faced with the idea of a “self-fulfilling prophecy” that cites their race as an indication of their intelligence. When faced with academic struggle, they suffer an identity crisis. This often centers on the belief, that their academic difficulty is a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with them. This leads many Asian-American teenagers and young adults into a cycle of psychological turmoil. When asked how to overcome this stereotype and dismantle systems pitting minorities against one another, Fang did not have a definitive answer. She emphasized the importance of cooperating with racial activist groups as a way of bridging the gap that has divided marginalized people. &nbsp; You can check out Fang’s Asian American Feminist blog at: Reappropriate.co Or through Facebook at: Facebook.com/reappropriate.co        by Alexis Payne  This past Monday, Deray McKesson, a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement (BLM), took over Yales Afro-American Cultural Center with an idea: “You are enough to start a movement. That is the story of Ferguson.” His audience was 200 potential movement-builders: Yale undergraduates, grad students, professors, and community members.  McKesson’s organizing and leadership experience brought him to Yale’s campus through the Divinity School’s Transformational Leadership Series. However, this particular talk—hosted by the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY) and the Yale College Democrats—was open to the public and more focused on McKesson’s ideology and the BLM Movement. Through his talk it became strikingly evident that BLM is revolutionary. Arising from a long history of institutionalized racism and systematic violence and drawing from the organizing efforts of past movements for Black Americans—its presence in the 21st century has given organizing a new and more democratic edge. This democratic nature allows BLM to be more nuanced and intersectional. In other words, the movement exists as a non-monolithic entity, fully capable of encapsulating the efforts, ideas and initiatives of a wide range of people. McKesson remarked, “In protest we say to the state, you are no longer worthy of my body and my soul. Either the state becomes worthy or we advocate the creation of a new state.” This seems to be one of the larger ideas of BLM. According to McKesson— as long as the goal remains consistent and aims towards complete freedom for Black people, BLM can mean a plethora of different things which still works for the movement because, “there a lot of ways to do the work.” With a movement this complicated, one is led to wonder what role BLM has at a place like Yale. McKesson reflected that there is power in people protesting in their own spaces and in transforming elitist institutions like Yale into environments that can nourish radical and free thoughts and ideas. He emphasized that the job of students is to wrestle with ideas in the classroom setting and put oneself in proximity to the work that is being done. McKesson advocated for awareness of the privilege that Yale students have and action based on that privilege. The method(s) by which this freedom should be achieved are debated and wrestled with on a daily basis. Is the state at all redeemable? Or should we be advocating the creation of a new one? The absence of centralization in BLM allows for these questions and perspectives to exist together in the same movement. While some might argue that this absence of centralization weakens the staying power of the movement, McKesson’s talk put forward a contrary narrative. Regardless, it was evident that there is something intrinsically powerful about the nature of BLM and the democratic basis of a movement of many leaders. Why do these students whisper? They whisper because they are undocumented students at Yale. Despite their talents and intelligence, undocumented students don’t have the same liberties as most Yalies. They cannot acquire internships, travel home with ease, or even work a campus job. What can documented and undocumented students do to change this? They can join FWD.us. FWD.us is a national immigration reform organization founded by Joe Green. The organization receives support from public figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman, and Drew Houston. Currently, FWD.us has four broad goals concerning comprehensive immigration reform: In order to achieve these goals, FWD.us works closely with its local and state chapters.  Yale has joined the movement by establishing the organizations first collegiate chapter: FWDYale. FWDYale was founded this semester by Carolina Rivera, after she interned at FWD.us. Prior to the internship, Rivera had no experience with immigration policy, but she did know that she wanted to “unite all the brilliant, young passionate students around the issue of immigration reform. Currently, FWD’s primary goal is to catalyze discussions among the student body so people become comfortable discussing immigration, and more specifically, the plight of being undocumented. To start the discussion, members of FWDYale are sharing their personal stories on FWD.us. Not all undocumented students are willing to share their stories yet. Some students do not feel safe or comfortable enough to disclose their legal status. FWDYale aims to change this by providing these students with a safe haven that doubles as an outlet where they can share their stories. Who can join FWDYale? In Rivera’s words, “I think anyone interested in joining this issue, politically, morally, should come. It has many different facets and people should join to explore this. We want people to start talking about it on a basic level [and] kindle conversation, [as it is] a very important issue in the current presidential debate. I want the student body to be informed about the issue.” If you are interested in FWDYale, like their Facebook page  and email any questions or suggestions to fwdyale@gmail.com Photo from http://blog.fwd.us/yale-university-chapter. 					This article was very well written.  I have become a member of FWD.us.        by Nicole Chavez Halloween has come early to UCLA, and it’s scarier than ever. On the night of Tuesday, October 6, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity commonly referred to on our campus as “Sig Ep” hosted a “Kanye Western” themed party. Baggy jeans replaced board shorts, padded bottoms were squeezed into jeans and leggings, and glossed lips were plumped and drawn on as partygoers delved into character. With charcoal rubbed across some of their foreheads and cheeks, students made the implications of this “Kanye Western” theme much more apparent. Obvious stereotypes, in some cases blatant blackface, ran loose like it was 1935. Various student organizations demanded an explanation for the fraternity’s promotion of racism on campus. It took the group several days to release a statement that circumvented an authentic apology. They dubiously claimed that the students in blackface were actually dressed up as miners, as a play on Kanye West’s song “Gold Digger.” Regardless of their rationalizations, the fraternity’s public statement fails to account for the numerous other students not dressed up as gold diggers who were apparently sporting black face at the event as well.  This instance of racial bigotry is not an isolated incident for UCLA. Over the past several years, students have become increasingly vocal about the racially discriminatory, and particularly anti-black sentiment that permeates the entire campus. Of all the UC schools, UCLA has the smallest population of black students, making up just 4% of undergraduates. This translates to only 1,189 out of nearly 30,000 students being black. Black students, along with other racial minorities on campus, have been on the receiving end of objectification by their peers at these frat parties. For example, in 2006, one fraternity hosted an “All Around the World Party” where students arrived in blackface or with taped eyelids. That same year, another fraternity organized a “South of the Border Party” where students were encouraged to climb a chain link fence and carry plastic babies with fake drugs in them. Fortunately, despite its small size, the black community at UCLA has been active in vocalizing its response to the “Kanye Western” party. Students have started two hashtags, #BlackBruinsMatter and #OurCultureIsNotACostume to expand the conversation regarding this issue to individuals outside of the university. Furthermore, the Afrikan [sic] Student Association is rallying for a more proactive response from the UCLA administration than the simple public statement it released several days following the incident: “We remind students that while they are free to celebrate in ways that draw on popular culture, their specific choices can cause harm and pain to fellow members of their community. Put simply: Just because you can do something, does not mean you should.” It may be fun to get dressed up and party, but never at the cost of making a parody of another individual’s culture and identity. You can be so many different things for Halloween—so many things! You can even dress up as inanimate objects or as imaginary creatures. Why of all costumes, do you choose to dress up as a member of a marginalized group? Think about it. Reflect. Read this list and share it with your friends to stop them from going viral on “Overheard at Yale” this Halloween: If your friends aren’t comfortable with your costume, take the hint and ditch it. Trust your instincts. If you feel reluctant to put on the costume, there’s probably a reason. I don’t care how much you wanted to be Princess Jasmine growing up, or the fact that you can belly dance like Shakira. No, just no. You are not directly impacted by the fact that people get every second Monday of October off to celebrate genocide. You don’t get to wear a headdress. You have never had a person cross the street to avoid walking past you on the sidewalk. You don’t get to put on blackface. You’ve never had a guy use the “All my ex-girlfriends are Asian” pick-up line on you. You don’t get to dress up as a geisha. You’ve never had to get stopped and searched (read: frisked) for wearing a hat at the airport. You don’t get to put on a turban. If your costume does not conflict with the admonitions above, enjoy your trick-or-treating! If it does, resort to your backup costume: a sleep deprived college student – all you need are your pajamas. And if you’re still unsure of your costume, consider skipping out on Halloween entirely. Instead, spend the night cozying up to some postcolonial literature. Just to preface, Frantz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks is NOT like whiteface for black people.        by Katie McCleary  Where I grew up on the Crow Reservation in Montana our closest neighbors are the Northern Cheyenne. As is common for many neighbors, especially those competing for resources, Crows and Northern Cheyenne were enemies. The U.S. Government assumed this was a minor issue when they forced the communities into reservations next to each other. Today, as a result of being so geographically close, there are many people of mixed Northern Cheyenne and Crow ancestry. Although the hostility has subsided, many children of this mixed heritage continue to be teased by their peers from both communities. Thankfully, at the Native American Cultural Center (NACC) the historical relations of student’s tribes have produced little more than lighthearted jokes. The NACC supports a diverse group of people who sometimes have nothing in common except the aboriginal continent of a variable number of their ancestors. Some students are closer related to those ancestors than others, some grew up in Native communities or on reservations, some have cultural knowledge, some have federal status—others do not. Our identities are inextricably intertwined by histories of colonialism but few recognize just how different. Identity is an issue we shy away from at the NACC. Most of the time it is spoken amongst friends in hesitant tones during study breaks or it arises in late night conversations. We tell each other that we don’t want to discuss identity because we don’t want to offend each other. One of the most common fears is that one student will share something very deeply cultural, perhaps a tradition or belief, while another student will feel left out because they don’t understand or share in the experience. But by treading carefully around insecurities we are limiting ourselves. If we don’t share our identities and histories, our peers are forced to rely on assumptions and information on paper. We use each other’s skin, hair, and eye color to gauge approximate distance from a Native ancestor. We rely upon information like blood quantum or enrollment to judge how culturally connected a person is or isn’t. We judge tribal affiliation based on whether we came from a Native community, city, rural area, reservation, or somewhere in between. But as we’ve learned from the U.S. Government, assumptions don’t cut it. Assumptions are inaccurate and cause pain. They tell us as much about someone’s identity as a checked box on a Yale enrollment application. Our identities are never what they at first may seem. But without healthy dialogue about identity no one would know this, at the NACC or on Yale campus more broadly. We must ask each other what our identity is and why. We must be unafraid to admit that our assumptions are most often wrong. It’s time to stop believing that identity is as simple as a percentage of blood that circulates within us or the shade of our skin. We can learn so much from each other if we’d only just ask and be willing to listen. 					this is an incredible article. 					Katie, youre awesome. Great article!        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon When asked about his affinity for incorporating office supplies into installations, Christopher Cozier grins and says, “there’s something mischievous about […] using the arsenal of bureaucracy for critique.” He quickly adds that his brand of “mischief” differs from the doctrinal radicalism of his peers. On October 8th the acclaimed Trinidadian artist, writer, and curator addressed a modest crowd of mostly graduate students in the basement of the Loria Center. His hour-long speech is an earnest primer on the art and philosophy of an inquisitive man. As a Caribbean exploring post-colonial society through his craft, Cozier walks an oddly charged line between the apolitical and the militant. His perspective on art and politics is more exploratory than ideological—this much is clear even in his demeanor, from the way he presents ideas in broad sketches to the way he speaks with a gentle lilt and prefaces all descriptions with a modest “kind of.” Cozier’s most strong-willed trait is a stubborn defiance of classification; his ethos, a commitment to surveying society in playful good faith. What is his medium? It’s hard to say. Since his first travels to the United States from Trinidad nearly 30 years ago to attend design school, he has experimented with painting, drawing, film, and a wide variety of installations. Cozier is the exceptional professional who remains in Trinidad, yet his existence is hardly provincial: love of country meets a cosmopolitan lifestyle that includes awards and exhibitions in far-flung Johannesburg, Amsterdam, Port-au-Prince, and Chicago. He ventures with genuine zest into the sociopolitical. He once hung 400 yellow rulers from the buttress of a Danish church in reference to the Peter Tosh song “400 Years.” (Peter Tosh was an influential Jamaican reggae musician—to Bob Marley as Malcolm X was to MLK. One of his best known works is a grid of hundreds of identically-wrapped, flag-topped sandwiches entitled “Attack of the Sandwich Men,” meant to question the conflation of modernity with organized conformity in his post-colonial world. He also collaborates with Caribbean-American janitors and films men in suits swinging nozzles—his two cents on Trinidad’s oil economy. Yet he rejects the label of “Caribbean artist” out of hand because it is too reductive. Cozier insists on being known as an individual exploring facets his own experience rather than as a tokenized public advocate for every dimension of his Trinidadian identity. He protests that he is neither a mouthpiece for Trinidad, nor a self-appointed authority on the Caribbean, or the Third World, or the African Diaspora. Therein lies the crucial paradox. It is political for him to make sociopolitical structures incidental to portrayals of humanity, and not the other way around. Universities love politicization and radicalism. From extremes come critical thinking, openness, and education—or so the logic goes. In such an environment, it is a breath of fresh air to hear the words of one who has chosen a distinct but more self-aware path, and such is the power of Christopher Cozier: artist and social interpreter extraordinaire.        by David Rico  No longer able to defend Christopher Columbus’s moral character, students at Yale and our peer institutions have challenged the idea of Indigenous Peoples’ Day by pointing to the positive aspects of the Columbian Exchange: corn for beef, squash for wheat, etc. As if any technological advancement or new crop were worth the loss of almost two entire continents and millions of lives. But why must this focus be so historical? Even today Native students at Yale are giving to this University. Take these past few days for example. We have collectively been working hard to make sure that over this long weekend students from all walks of life, all creeds and backgrounds will for a moment, see the world through a different pair of eyes. We are pouring our hearts, souls, and precious Sunday homework time into making sure that this university, and this city, can know the privilege of experiencing an Indigenous point of view. Some will look at us as if we are threatening. That is natural. We are asking for a change and change always comes with a dash of pain. But through all of that, we are also working to show you how joyous and beautiful contemporary Native culture can be. Not all universities will show you that. When someone talks about Native people, American history, or Indigenous Peoples’ Day, now you can recall our faces, our food, our laughter and our ideas. In these lie answers to the world’s greatest challenges: sustainable agriculture, public health, gender equality, or alternative medicine. We are still sharing with you, offering the new tools you need to mend a broken world. You are already fed, what will sustain you more than new thoughts? You are Yalies, intellectuals, mental prizefighters. Here is your new pair of gloves. We do this as an act of love and pride in ourselves. We do this as an act of faith in you. It is genuine hunger to see this world become better for our children and yours. Thank you Yale and her community for the opportunity to come live and study at one of the most outstanding institutions of human knowledge in the history of mankind. Here, in this mindset of gratitude, I hope that you can also appreciate that a group of students on campus feel so passionate about celebrating our experience with you. Happy Indigenous People’s Day. Indigenous Peoples’ Day 2015, hosted by the Association of Native Americans at Yale, featured a two-day program of demonstrations on the New Haven Green and Cross Campus, a keynote speech by Hawaiian scholar J. Kēhaulani Kauanui, and community dinners with the Yale and New Haven Latino communities. With partners Unidad Latina en Accion and MEChA de Yale, ANAAY organized the largest and most inclusive IPD yet, with hundreds in attendance from Yale and New Haven, from Native communities north and south of the border. We shared food, from Montana dry meat soup to Mexican tamales; we shared music, from Blue Feather’s Powwow jams to a Mayan nursery rhyme; we shared spirits, using sage and copal.  Last year, with a similar lineup, ANAAY was able to secure a proclamation of support from the City of New Haven for IPD, but we continue to organize and unify the Native community at Yale and in New Haven to abolish Columbus Day and take pride year round in our identities. The event was co-sponsored by the Native American Cultural Center, La Casa, the UOC, the Intercultural Affairs Committee, and Davenport College. &nbsp;           photos by Arianna Neal         by Hawa Adula  Jess X Chen and Will Giles, two Asian American spoken word poets, performed at the Calhoun Cabaret Monday night and gave all audience members a lesson in intersectionality. The poems covered a range of topics including colonialism, queer love, womanhood, and identity. Chen and Giles’s pieces on colonialism felt particularly riveting in the wake of the excitement surrounding the campus-wide celebration of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Will Giles, in his poem about Pokemon and depression, renamed depression a “fourth hand dildo.” He assumed that if depression was renamed a fourth hand dildo there would finally be something light hearted about an all too serious condition. This fourth hand dildo is meant to be what depression is not: something that is funny. Giles’ fourth hand dildo analogy can be applied to all the topics covered at the show: the struggles of being everything from queer, a minority, female, male, immigrant, to just broken. “Imagination is daring to love what is not in front of us, a new definition of home when the word betrays us”- Jess X Chen Our fourth hand dildos, the identities and the names that define us, are our own little burdens to carry. They are the feelings of resentment and hopelessness against a white America that wants to crush our spirits, the confusion of not being able to reconcile our faiths with our sexualities, and the choice of marginalizing our identities, like our ancestors experienced, or revitalizing these identities with a final end goal of self-love. “How do we keep these brown boys above ground without a rope; how do we tell the difference between a lifeline and a exit sign?” Will Giles Giles and Chen’s poems were a powerful reminder that the various parts of our identities can intersect and find peace with one another. The poems prompted listeners to understand the beauty that encompasses their varied identities. Chen’s fierce rebuttal against critiques of queer love in her poem about the history of homosexuality in nature made listeners agents of their own identity and exploration. It challenged us to never let “infant[ile]” condemnations against our identities make us stop searching for the person we were meant to be. “Now I do not lament my lack of roots, instead, I grow them myself”  Will Giles Our identities are not independent beings; they are the intersection between our cultures and histories; our future and our present, soon to be pasts. These identities, our fourth hand dildos, are an unshakable presence. It is up to us to figure out how to live with our fourth hand dildos. It is up to us to decide whether we will be crushed under the weight of our confusion, anger, and resentment or as Chen said, “soar in the direction of our dreams.”        by Nicole Chavez  Like most of its Ivy League peers, Yale has never been the front-runner on diversity. Established in 1701, the colleges founding purpose was to serve as an institution of higher education where the white, wealthy elite would send their sons to be groomed into polished politicians and stoic stockbrokers. Given the great work of Yales PR team, one would feel safe to assume that the university has since then made great strides towards cultivating a more diverse community  students, faculty, and staff alike. Recently, Yale has boasted its efforts in encouraging the matriculation of a more racially and socioeconomically heterogeneous class. However, on Founders Day last week, this declaration to the schools progress on issues of diversity was challenged. A poster was anonymously put up on Cross Campus on Tuesday night  only to be taken down four hours later Wednesday morning  that announced that there is only a 1% average increase in black faculty at Yale per century. The bottom of the poster boldly declared: The students are waiting. Your move Yale. However, as this poster shows, students are not waiting. They are mobilizing in attempt to tackle the daunting task of diversifying the faculty at this university. The presence of a diverse faculty at any academic institution is beneficial for several reasons. Having diversity mirrored in the faculty provides students from marginalized communities with role models with whom they can relate. At a privileged institution like Yale, it is especially important that students of color are successful, especially in the classroom. However, at times, students of color do not become aware of the impact the faculty has on them until they experience their elitism first hand. For Ivonne Gonzalez 16, her experience growing up in a low-income neighborhood of color, conditioned her into perceiving university professors a certain way: The image that came into my mind when someone said professor was a white, older man. It was not until meeting Professor Schmidt-Camacho and Master Pitti, who are both phenomenal Latino professors at Yale that Gonzalez realized how important their presence on campus was, both in supporting the 9% of undergraduates at Yale who identify as Latinx and producing scholarship in the fields of Latinx history and culture.[1] Besides contributing to the experience of students of color and other marginalized groups on campus, diverse faculty also enhance the college experience of white students by exposing them to different perspectives. In fact, professors who identify as a member of a minority group often are the people most qualified and eager to instruct classes in under supported areas of academia, such as ethnic or queer or gender studies. This gives students a chance to learn about the narratives of marginalized communities from individuals who can speak truly to these experiences. Reports completed by Yales Office of Institutional Research (OIR) point out a lag in the increase of diversity within the faculty at the school. In the 2014 to 2015 school year, racial minorities and females represented 16.1% and 29.0% of individuals on the faculty ladder, respectively. Of the 16.1% of people of color in the faculty, only one Native American faculty member was represented that academic year. Other racial groups still stood at relatively low numbers, with 20, 24, and 60 Latinxs, African Americans, and Asians and Asian-Americans present on the ladder, respectively. These numbers are diminutive in comparison to the 504 white faculty members at Yale. With nearly 40% of students enrolled at the university identifying as people of color, it is evident that the administration must put forth renewed effort into diversifying its faculty pool.[2] Along with undergraduates, graduate students are also starting their own initiatives to bring reform to the faculty hiring process at Yale. On the afternoon of Wednesday, October 7, the graduate English department organized a panel titled Race, Gender, Sexuality, and Belonging in the Academy. The event hosted three professors, Angela Onuwuachi-Willig, visiting professor at Yale Law School; Inderpal Grewal, professor of Womens, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and John Dovidio, professor in Psychology. The three convened at this event to share with a group of about 60 graduate students the practices of the university that contribute to the lack of diverse faculty. Professor Grewal, referencing Cheryl Harris text Whiteness as Property, described the situation adeptly by drawing a parallel between the struggle for people of color to own property and the fight for marginalized communities to obtain and preserve a space for themselves as faculty in academia. One solution to this issue Grewal suggested was reforming the tenure track which she claimed reproduced hierarchy in pernicious ways. These detrimental results are evident in the OIR reports on the headcounts of tenured faculty. In popular academic departments such as Economics and History where there were 30 and 37 tenured professors in the 2014 to 2015 academic year, women only accounted for 4 and 8 of these people, respectively. Disparities only worsened in STEM-related departments such as Physics, where only 3 of the 25 tenured faculty members are women.[3] As Onuwuachi-Willig mentioned, the goal of the university should not only be to recruit diverse faculty to Yale, but to make sure they stay here and establish institutional authority as well. This, however, can only be done, as Dovidio stated, by forgoing Yales adherence to tradition and desire to keep people happy. Administrators and community members must be willing to have difficult conversations on how to promote diversity and inclusivity. While the panel on Wednesday focused on the faculty issue, some students suggest that these solutions must extend beyond underrepresentation in academia. Gonzalez, who is also a fellow in the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship program, which strives to provide undergraduates with resources necessary to enter academia, had the following to say about this aforementioned point: Contrary to what some people might think, diversity is not just about increasing the numbers of students and professors of color at Yale. Working towards diversity is also about working towards a better, improved Yale where students can be exposed to a wide array of perspectives. Its about progressing knowledge production to include the histories and insights of populations who have been erased in dominant Eurocentric scholarship. One of the professed goals of Yale as an institution is to mold us into leaders that will initiate positive change in our communities. If this happens to be the case, then why is the school pushing back against students attempts to create change now? [1] Office of Institutional Research. Yale Factsheet Yale University.

According to CNN it was the frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. Various online polls have the not-so-junior junior Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders as the victor. Pretty much everyone agrees that former Rhode Island Governor (and former Republican) Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Senator Jim Webb bombed the debate spectacularly. As for former Maryland Governor (and current heartthrob) Martin O’Malley, Buzzfeed has him pegged as the hottest candidate around. &nbsp;  &nbsp; According to a Gawker article on the topic, “a little secret of political journalism is that the vast majority of it is just some jerk’s opinion, which has a scientific value roughly equal to your own idiot opinion.” Inspired by the hard-hitting journalists over at Gawker, I’ve decided that it’s time to share my own idiot opinions on this debate, so let me break it down for you all. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Admit it, if Lincoln Chafee hadn’t listed his CV as his intro, you would have had no idea who he was. In fact, after that intro, I still had no idea what he stands for or what he wants for the nation. The only thing I know is that irrelevant people don’t have scandals (and that this was a not-so-subtle way to bring up e-mailghazi). Also, Lincoln Chafee was literally a Republican during his time in the Senate. &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; Jim Webb also gives a CV in which he tells us that he was in the Reagan administration. He does know that this isn’t the GOP debate, right? &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; For real though, my favorite part is how proud he was of all of his children and their awesome careers. Except for Julia the massage therapist whose name he almost forgot entirely. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Martin O’Malley gives a real introduction to his campaign and not just a summary of his accomplishments. For a guy whose platform could probably consist entirely of his pecs, he manages to put climate change, gun control, and income inequality on the table pretty eloquently. Fair warning here, I feel the Bern. And yes, I have gotten tested recently. Turns out I tested positive for endorsing a so-called “socialist.” (Karl Marx would beg to differ on whether or not Sanders is a socialist, but that’s a question for another time). Anyway, Sanders’ intro is also issues-based, but he repeats some of what O’Malley literally just said, and that takes some of the steam out of it. Still, he manages to drop Citizens United and youth of color underemployment as critical issues in his campaign. That’s a pretty important angle to take for a guy who most people of color in this country haven’t even heard of. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Maybe it’s the hair, or maybe it’s because she’s practically American royalty, but Hilary Clinton reminds me of the rightful King of Narnia, Aslan.  &nbsp; In true Aslan-esque fashion, she addresses the public like she owns the place. Clinton is in her element here. Sometimes I can’t believe that she lost in ’08, but then I remember that Barack Obama is so likable that you forget he condones aggressive use of drones that kill innocent children every single day. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Not long after the introductions, each candidate was asked about their electability. Sanders defended calling himself a “democratic socialist,” and Hilary Clinton managed to argue (elegantly) that capitalism is about small business first and foremost. Martin O’Malley had a few sour moments discussing policing during his time as Baltimore Mayor, and Lincoln Chafee managed to bullshit his way through convincing Anderson Cooper that he’s not still a Republican. The best moment came when Jim Webb was asked about his views on affirmative action (and really minorities as a whole). &nbsp;  &nbsp; Yeah, Jim Webb said that he was part of “white culture” and that progressive race politics were pretty new to the democratic party. He argued he’s not out of touch with Democrats because of the party’s traditions. Well, it’s hard to argue with Webb here. The Democrats did support Jim Crow, and way back in the day, the did support slavery, but I didn’t think that anyone in 2015 could still be a Dixiecrat. I was wrong. So wrong. The best Lincoln Chafee blunder came when he was asked about his Senate vote in favor of repealing Glass-Steagall in 1999. If Chafee is to be believed, it being his first vote in the Senate meant that he couldn’t understand what was going on in the bill. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Sure. His pro-corporate stance had nothing to do with the fact that he was literally a Republican Senator at the time. When it came to foreign policy, Sanders managed to get the crowd on his side by saying he would not support having American troops on the ground in Syria, but in terms of negotiating the United States’ relationship with Russia, Sanders seemed a little lost. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Despite being a master of spin the whole night, not even Secretary Clinton was not without her missteps. &nbsp;  &nbsp; When asked about how Ms. Clinton’s first term would be different from an Obama third term, she responds by saying that she would be the first woman president. As awesome and inspirational as I think that is, I think Cooper was looking for a policy difference when he asked that question, not a demographic difference. Unlike last month’s GOP debate, there were however, a few bright spots worth mentioning. &nbsp;  &nbsp; When asked the simple question: “Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?” Senator Sanders responded quickly and forcefully: “Black lives matter.” He went on to say that in this country, racism means that black people like Sandra Bland can be pulled over in a routine traffic stop and end up dead in a jail cell three days later. Sanders was also his consistent in his criticism of Wall Street, even going so far as to tell Clinton directly that “Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress.” As one would expect from a former Secretary of State, Ms. Clinton managed to lay out the most coherent perspective on relations with Russia as well as on the turmoil throughout the Middle East (though I thought I detected an air of the interventionism she’s infamous for). Clinton’s rhetoric on banks was much harsher than it has been in the past (though both Sanders and O’Malley pointed out that her policy proposals are nowhere near as harsh as theirs), and she admitted that she would like to see executives serve jail time for their role in the 2009 financial crisis. Martin O’Malley served the important role in criticizing what many progressives see as the weakest spots in Clinton and Sanders’ respective campaigns: banking and guns. O’Malley stated that despite his 2008 support of her, Clinton’s unwillingness to be hard on banks after the financial crisis had made him feel differently about her in this cycle. With respect to Sanders, O’Malley joined a Clinton-led tag-team attacking the Vermont Senator’s support of rural gun owners. While Clinton chastising Sanders felt like empty talk, O’Malley was able to bolster his argument using his concrete accomplishments in Maryland gun legislation. At the end of the debate, it was O’Malley’s willingness to criticize the frontrunners that left him the winner in my eyes. He spoke well, and his politics shone through as the middle ground between a somewhat cranky (though ultimately correct) Sanders and a hackneyed (though sophisticated) Clinton. Polls show that he’s a longshot to our next President, but if he keeps up performances like this, I’d be shocked if he doesn’t end up someone’s VP. &nbsp;  					Please do more election coverage. You rock.        by Ishrat Mannan and Didem Kaya “It is Palestine. Not a dream, but a people. Not a refugee camp, but a country alive in its peoples hearts.”  Vijay Prashad  “We are not myths of the past, ruins in the jungle, or zoos. We are people and we want to be respected, not to be victims of intolerance and racism.”  Rigoberta Menchú This past weekend, we celebrated the richness of Palestinian culture on Old Campus with the Second Annual Palestinian Cultural Festival. Simultaneously, New Haven celebrated over 500 years of resistance with Indigenous People’s Day. The Smile for Palestine event included Middle Eastern food, Palestinian music and dabke (traditional dance), and art while Indigenous People’s Day involved native music, poetry, dance, a keynote speaker, and a community meal.  This year it was coincidence that these two events took place within the span of one week, but the connections between these two struggles have been increasingly highlighted by Palestinians, Natives, as well as outsiders in support of these movements such as ourselves. The Association of American Studies declared an academic boycott on Israel. It is important to remember that AMST is a place where professors from Black Studies and Native Studies come together under the same umbrella. For better or worse many of these fields are still considered subfields under AMST in many universities. This allows for an ASA that is generally aware of historical connections between settler colonialism at ‘home’ and ‘abroad.’ Some Yale students might remember Native American Studies Professor Steven Salaita visited campus last April and spoke on a panel co-sponsored by the Council on Middle Eastern Studies, the Program in American Studies, and the Yale Group for the Study of Native America called Historicizing Settler Colonialism: From Wisconsin to Palestine. Last year Salaita’s story made national news when he went to Twitter to express his views regarding Operation Protective Edge. In an unprecedented case, the  University of Illinois fired him despite having granted him tenured job offer at the American Indian Studies Program with allegations of hate speech. &nbsp;   The events this weekend on Yales campus were primarily cultural, putting forward an association of Palestine and of Natives outside the realm of conflict or victimhood. Too often, the stories of an oppressed people are told as simply that  nothing more and nothing less. Smile for Palestine and Indigenous People’s Day fights back on the dominant narrative and presents itself as the storyteller through celebrating vibrant culture, music, and food that existed before erasure.  We must understand that the cultural is always political; these two realms cannot be divorced. However, there is power in taking an approach that is less overtly political and more celebratory. To focus on the people rather than the oppressor, to celebrate endurance, to reclaim history in an apolitical way is still infused with political statement.     Tragedy narratives may seem appealing at first. They certainly have been utilized by people on all ends of the political spectrum. Genocides, oppressions, occupations are incredibly difficult to communicate. So one might feel the need to find strength in pushing tragedy narratives to rightfully get across how devastating circumstances have been. A less considered effect of tragedy narratives came up in Birgit Rasmussen’s Native American Literature seminar where students discussed how tragedy is a convenient way to frame things as having ‘sad, unfortunate endings.’ What happened was tragic, but it is in the past tense. It happened. What is more is that it alludes to an idea of replacement of indigeneity, at which point the settler can claim s/he is “American,” or Native, without acknowledging the millions of original peoples. Those familiar with the Palestinian resistance movement will remember that a common Zionist argument is that Palestine does not exist. Palestinians did not exist. A land without a people for a people without a land. How familiar that sounds. Manifest Destiny, anyone? We want to recognize that the cultures are dynamic. That the culture that exists currently is different from the one that pre-existed colonial powers. However, the growth and presence of occupation cannot diminish the original culture. We keep this in mind as we uphold and echo a rallying principle of Palestinians: existence is resistance. The efforts on campus that you may have participated in, walked by, or simply seen advertised should be seen for the gesture that they are. An attempt to keep alive one’s story, heritage, and culture despite and in spite of  the tragedy narratives or contexts of conflict that exist today. Realize you do not have to be a native to this land, a Palestinian, or have ancestry tracing back to the pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower to be invested in this conversation. Know that your understanding of history, race, and power are influenced by the dominant narrative. We all exist in spheres with dominant and not so dominant narratives, but you have a stake in how that dominant narrative can be reclaimed, retold, expanded, or changed for the better. Food, music, gathering  these are all acts of holding on. Remembrance becomes a revolutionary act when it tells a story that is seldom told or too often forgotten/distorted. As we continue as students of Yale, citizens of this world, people who aim to be on the right side of history  let us push ourselves to remember. Honestly, correctly, and with courage.            by Alejandra Padín-Dujon During his talk “Hispanics in the Legal Profession” at La Casa two weeks ago, alum Manuel del Valle (Law ’74) proclaimed the following to a packed house: “It’s something you need to know, because it’s part of your history. A history of what? Of struggle.” The “it” in question is Gonzalo v. Westminster, a 1947 federal court case that ended Anglo-Mexican segregation in public schools in Orange County, California. By reaffirming its importance, del Valle proposed three radical truths: One: Latinos have a storied and unique history as residents of these United States. Two: We have not just a right, but an obligation to know and honor this history. Three: This history is characterized by energy and activism, subverting the myth that positive change is an automatic consequence of some fundamentally good American moral character. Surpassing what was expected of him as a child from the New York City projects, del Valle earned degrees from Princeton, Yale, and the London School of Economics, all the while embodying the spirit of grassroots activism. At Yale, del Valle worked with a close-knit group of friends to lobby the administration for funding to support Latino students, to establish Yale’s first Puerto Rican history seminar, and to found the Puerto Rican student organization Despierta Boricua, which remains active today. Del Valle laughs when recounting their proposal-writing campaign’s mantra: “We don’t have the money; you have the money. So, dish it out!” Del Valle’s impassioned monologue, however, was not limited to the past. He spent a substantial amount of time offering advice on how to navigate academia and the legal profession with morals intact. On lawyering: “Follow the trail of those who came before.” On materialism: “Nothing wrong with making money—unless you become hostage to it.” On leadership: “If you can’t follow, you can’t lead. If you can’t listen, you can’t lead.” Between his boldness, charisma, and larger-than-life personal story, del Valle electrified the crowd at La Casa. His presence acted as a reminder that the building stands as a monument to militant student activism. He confirmed that La Casa is one of the few spaces on campus in which ethnic communalism can be celebrated and materialism disparaged. It is an environment in which language of moral obligation is not a hotly debated political philosophy, but a reality learned, cherished, and lived.        by Ashia Ajani  My name is Ashia Ajani, and I’m casually pansexual. I like poetry, cats and basic human rights, as well as safe queer spaces. I usually operate on a “if you ask, I’ll answer” system, which often backfires into a slew of intimate questions which I would rather avoid in the first place. I am out to most of my friends, am somewhat out to my father, but not to my mother. Not smothering, but “quieting” my queerness has been crucial to my survival; I know this to be a similar experience for a lot of queer youth. Still, I am hopeful that moving forward, we can cultivate a sense of understanding when it comes to queer students and their experiences. The most fundamental way, I think, is to use the resources we have at hand. In May 2015, President Salovey announced an enormous grant given by Yale alumnus Stephen A. Schwarzman intended to renovate and create a new campus center. Schwarzman Center has become somewhat of a running joke among Yale students: what is there to do with all this money and space? Due to the vast array of queer identities, it is necessary that we create an LGBTQ space somewhere on campus. Oftentimes, we share spaces with other marginalized people that may not fall under the spectrum of queerness. We have a very definitive presence on campus that sometimes is not recognized in the way other identities are regarded. There should be a safe space where we can gather, chill, laugh, cry and discuss queer issues without feeling obligated to rush our conversations. What better place to do that than a completely new, spacious building that is coming very soon? My desire for an exclusively queer space stems out of my respect for the cultural houses. As a person of color, specifically a Black person, it is comforting to walk into the Afro-American Cultural Center and be with people who know my struggle, who possess a love and respect for me that I believe transcends all others. That feeling is able to flourish because we have a space where we can love each other and love ourselves unapologetically. We are a part of a larger community, the Yale community, but we still belong to each other on a deeper level given our common identity. The insurmountable joy I get from being around other Black people is the joy I want to feel when I walk into queer spaces. It is the joy I believe every marginalized group needs. We spend so much of our time fighting; it is imperative that we are provided an outlet to release that pain. When marginalized groups rally for each other’s individual space, that is when we start productive conversations about solidarity. As a freshman, I am constantly being told that I am entering Yale University at a pivotal point in its history. The Class of 2019 is the most diverse class of Yale College’s history, we have three new cultural center deans determined to enhance the Yale experience for students of color through collaboration and innovation. Our “liberalism” cannot be taken at face value. The impact of our actions will determine what will remain when we have left Yale’s Campus. If we are so committed to cultural change and justice, an exclusively LGBTQ space must be a part of that journey.        by Hawa Adula  Cast: Idris Elba, Abraham Attah, Opeyemi Fagbohungbe, Richard Pepple Director: Cary Fukunaga It is easy to lose track of events that are happening outside our own little bubbles. There are so many horrific events happening around the world that we desensitize ourselves to in order to avoid becoming a jumble of emotions. Sometimes, though, sensitivity and emotions are necessary. After all there is a reason why we feel. Beasts of No Nation forces watchers to confront a painful reality most wish they could ignore: the psychological ruin inflicted on child soldiers by war. Agu is one such child soldier. Separated from his mother and forced to watch as military forces senselessly murder his father and brother, Agu reasons that he is avenging his family when he is forced to join a militia. As the title suggests, the setting of the movie is not revealed. Watchers simply know that it is in an African country, and that the characters speak Twi, a language traditionally spoken in Ghana. The abstract nature of the movie suggests that the events that unfold in the movie, i.e. war, could happen anywhere in the world. Cary Fukunaga, the director, does a good job of detailing the violences that constitute warfare: murder, rape, death. The few clear plot events that happen, such as the ransacking of towns, are vivid and clear. Nothing is left to the imagination. It is as if Fukunaga wanted this outright portrayal of violence and death to contrast the less explicit feelings of guilt, hurt, and confusion that surround Agu. Agu is the focus of this movie, but the silence of Strika, another child soldier, speaks volumes to the powerful juxtaposition of external and internal violence that Fukunaga creates in the film. He is unable to talk: he does not speak of the war, he does not speak of his family, he does not speak of his emotions. The silence of Strika is the inability to comprehend, much less voice, the emotions that come with the murdering of children, mothers, fathers, and innocent people that Strika and Agu both participate in. Agu feels guilty about the devastation that occurs and his role in it. He says “Sun, why are you shining at this world? I am wanting to catch you in my hands, to squeeze you until you can not shine no more. That way, everything is always dark and nobody’d ever having to see all the terrible thins that are happening here.” The movie somehow finds a way to end on a positive note. We see that Agu and the other children in his militia are brought to a center that helps them cope with all they have seen and done in the war.  However, we do not get to see enough of his progress once he is there. This may suggest that the process of healing is never ending; that war may be temporary but its effects are permanent. Or maybe, it is a way of helping viewers understand what all recovering child soldiers want  to heal without the presence of prying eyes, to heal without being judged. Beasts of No Nation is overall an informative and emotional film that is well worth the watch. Fukunaga incorporates humor, sadness, love, and healing and somehow they all come together to make a great account of the life of child soldiers. There is a lot to be learned and felt from this film, so let your emotions be put through the ringer without the shield of denial. Be unafraid to counter this unspoken inclination towards desensitization. Beasts of No Nations is available for streaming on Netflix.         by Alejandra Padín-Dujon Framed by a portrait of Yale graduate Yung Wing, the first Chinese student to graduate from an American university in 1854, Timothy Dwight Master Mary Lui outlined the institutional barriers to promoting Asian American Studies. Perhaps the most significant is the mechanics of the hiring process. Yale’s social scientists, whose departments hold much of the power to recruit Asian American Studies faculty “see themselves as theorists,” she said. This approach clashes with the “integrated approach between theory and application” that Lui identifies as the hallmark of ethnic studies and its greatest asset. The spirit of the night—the hope for change—captivated students and faculty as they strategized to boost Asian American Studies at Yale. On the night of October 19, the center hosted an Asian American Studies meet-and-greet featuring Yale’s four Asian American Studies professors: Master Mary Lui of Timothy Dwight College, historian and professor of “Asian American History, 1800 to the Present”; newly hired Assistant Professor of English Sunny Xiang; visiting novelist Susan Choi ’90; and Ethnicity, Race, and Migration lecturer Quan Tran. Hosted by Asian American Studies Coordinators Catherine Tarleton ’16 and Hayun Cho ’17, the event comes as part of a renewed campaign to draw attention to Yale’s failure to establish an Asian American Studies program or even provide the minimum of two Asian American Studies courses per year—as it promised students in 1987. In 2014, concerned students revived the Asian American Studies Task Force (AASTF), a student activist collective originally founded in the 1970s. That year, Yale provided only one Asian American Studies course for the entire 2014-15 academic year: Master Lui’s “Asian American History.” This past spring, the AACC and the task force held the 2015 Yale Asian American Studies Conference, attended by over 100 students. In addition to concerns over the scarcity of American Studies courses, many worry that the combined burdens of teaching, research, and occupying innumerable leadership positions place unsustainable pressure on Yale’s tiny cohort of ethnic studies professors, threatening the future of Asian American Studies here at Yale (as well as ethnic studies more broadly) rather than affirming it. “If I wasn’t master of TD college, I’d be teaching an upper-level Asian-American history course,” Lui said. Even after the hiring of Sunny Xiang, the English department’s first Asian American Studies specialist, in the fall of this year, substantial concerns remain. Xiang will teach “Asian American Literature” in the spring, but the junior seminar will have limited enrollment and priority will go to English majors first and foremost—not to students of ethnic studies. “I’d like to teach a bigger class, but honestly, I’m still getting the lay of the land,” said Xiang, echoing a similar comment made by Susan Choi minutes earlier to an eager graduate student. “I don’t know who or how to even ask for that.” Since Asian American Studies has no department, and ER;M faculty have their primary posts elsewhere, Lui noted that “we can recommend, we can push—but at the end of the day, it’s not our decision.” The TD master expressed some optimism about representation of ethnic studies in the humanities. As for allegations that budget cuts have undermined the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration department? They’re largely myth, Lui said. “ER;M is fairly healthy.” Even so, financial constraints will prevent the department from tapping any post-docs and graduate students to teach Asian American Studies courses as they have in the past. Despite the discouraging reality, student activists at the AACC work tirelessly to address what they see as fundamental defects in the system. Among the attendees of Monday night’s meet-and-greet was task force member Alexander Zhang ’18. He recently challenged the administration to commit to “a permanent expansion of Asian American Studies at Yale and to publicize a timeline of actions it will take to achieve this goal” in the Yale Daily News. Amidst ongoing conversations about the renaming of Calhoun College and faculty diversity, Yale’s activists are not giving up the fight. According to Catherine Tarleton, the next big move may be to integrate the voices of La Casa, the Native American Cultural Center, the House, and the Asian American Cultural Center to address the plight of ethnic studies. For anyone interested in the work of the Asian American Studies Task Force, they maintain a mailing list that is open to the public. Email crystal.kong@yale.edu to be added.        In anticipation of the Halloween weekend soon to arrive at Yale, an email was sent out by Dean Burgwell Howard and the Intercultural Affairs Committee in which they implored the Yale body to “avoid those circumstances that threaten our sense of community or disrespects, alienates or ridicules segments of our population based on race, nationality, religious belief or gender expression.” The email also encouraged Yale students to “take the time to consider their costumes and the impact it may have.” What was simply a request from Yales Intercultural Affairs Committee for students to reconsider culturally insensitive costumes was met with criticism when an email was sent out to the students of Silliman College by the Associate Master, Erika Christakis. She wrote her email, as she says, in response to “students who were frustrated by the mass email sent to the student body about appropriate Halloween-wear.” Associate Master Erika Christakis, In your email, you defend the right to wear racist or marginalizing costumes as free speech and accuse the Intercultural Affairs Committee of imposing bureaucratic restrictions on the student body. You deem the call for sensitivity “censure”  one which you say comes “from above”, not from the students, as if the repeated requests of many students of color do not count. To equate a suggestion of the IAC, a committee created to challenge bias and promote cultural awareness, respect, and appreciation on campus, with an “institutional exercise of implied control over college students” further erases the voices of the students they stand to protect. The contents of your email were jarring and disheartening. Your email equates old traditions of using harmful stereotypes and tropes to further degrade marginalized people, to preschoolers playing make believe. This both trivializes the harm done by these tropes and infantilizes the student body to which the request was made. You fail to distinguish the difference between cosplaying fictional characters and misrepresenting actual groups of people. In your email, you ask students to look away if costumes are offensive, as if the degradation of our cultures and people, and the violence that grows out of it is something that we can ignore. We were told to meet the offensive parties head on, without suggesting any modes or means to facilitate these discussions to promote understanding. Giving “room” for students to be “obnoxious” or “offensive”, as you suggest, is only inviting ridicule and violence onto ourselves and our communities, and ultimately comes at the expense of room in which marginalized students can feel safe. These discussions are not new, and have been happening nationally. To ask marginalized students to throw away their enjoyment of a holiday, in order to expend emotional, mental, and physical energy to explain why something is offensive, is  offensive. In the age of the internet, resources can easily be found to explain the history and consequences of these actions. The role of marginalized people on campus is not, and should not be, to constantly educate our peers if they ignore the many opportunities offered  like the one provided by the Intercultural Affairs Committees email  to self-explore and learn. After receiving responses from students and alumni through both social media and email, you responded to critics of your email with a link to the Atlantic Magazine article, “The Coddling of the American Mind.” Not only are you calling our calls to be respected as human beings and not costumes, coddling, but you use an article that doesn’t consider the fact that marginalized people largely do not have the protected upbringings the authors describe. We are not asking to be coddled. The real coddling is telling the privileged majority on campus that they do not have to engage with the brutal pasts that are a part of the costumes they seek to wear. We, however, simply ask that our existences not be invalidated on campus. This is us asking for basic respect of our cultures and our livelihoods. To be a student of color on Yale’s campus is to exist in a space that was not created for you. From the Eurocentric courses, to the lack of diversity in the faculty, to the names of slave owners and traders that adorn most of the buildings on campus  all are reminders that Yale’s history is one of exclusion. An exclusion that was based on the same stereotypes and incorrect beliefs that students now seek to wear as costumes. Stereotypes that many students still face to this day when navigating the university. The purpose of blackface, yellowface, and practices like these were meant to alienate, denigrate, and to portray people of color as something inferior and unwelcome in society. To see that replicated on college campuses only reinforces the idea that this is a space in which we do not belong. Sincerely, Concerned Yale Students, Alumni, Family, Faculty, and Staff Add your signature to the open letter here. Thank you Ryan Wilson for writing this letter. 					Its time we encourage people to behave respectfully instead of accepting their rude ignorance that negatively affects people. 					You have GOT to be kidding me. You just proved Christakis right, and you probably dont even realize it. What the hell has happened to Americas college campuses? Places that used to be bastions of free speech and tough academic exchanges are full of intolerant boo hoo you stepped on my widdle feelings pre-schoolers where butt-hurt runs rampant. Disgusting. 					Being rude and ignorant is a right afforded in the First Amendment.  If people have to deal with offensive things like gays in public, then the public should have to deal with rude ignorance. 					This is another attempt to censor free speech using coopted language of toleration. Most of us are now awake to the use of coded language by these groups. And we see it in the letter above. Notice how the opposing speech is labeled as an eraser of voices. This is the technique of silencing the opposition by claiming that their opinion is silencing you or invalidating your experiences or making you feel opposed. And, notice that the act of calling for toleration is itself labelled to be an act of violence against those holding the opinions stated above. When will this group wake up to realize that they have coopted the language of race, group, identity, privilege, and oppression into an instrument of oppression and censorship? What is next? Would you like to ban criticism of ISIS on campus for fear it might offend any Muslims? 					Stupidity beyond words. So much for free speech, eh? 					I would rather kill myself than be in college nowadays. What should be the most fun 4 years of your life has turned into a whine-a-thon by the most thin-skinned, ridiculously intolerant people on earth. Its like they cant be happy if theyre not complaining about something, and the something is usually the most ridiculous offense anyone could imagine. Jeez, watch Revenge of the Nerds or Animal House or something if youve forgotten how to have fun in college. 					This letter appears to conflate the defence of free speech with support for institutionalised racism. Anyone who entertains this tenuous association needs to think again. The idea that a person should not have to expendenergy to explain why something is offensive is ludicrous. If you are offended, it is your job to challenge the offender in a civilised way. Demanding that someone else remove the risk of offence from your life is not an acceptable imposition in a free society. Or have we forgotten that good things come from dissenting (and, to some, offensive) voices, not least of which being the rise of equal rights for the disadvantaged? Subduing free speech hurts you more than it helps you. 					That this would happen at Yale that used to have one of the strongest statements for free speech in the WORLD, really shows you how far down the toilet higher education has gone. The good thing is that every one of those signatories now has stated their position and every future employer out in the real world can ask themselves whether someone so shallow and uncaring for free speech and obviously so coddled and unable to cope with views they do not share is someone that should be hired in the first place. 					Thanks for this.  Hell will freeze over before I EVER consider a Yale grad for employment. 					As a father I am seriously reconsidering the wisdom of investing in my childrens higher education. 					you ask students to “look away” if costumes are offensive, as if the degradation of our cultures and people, and the violence that grows out of it is something that we can ignore. thats the precise argument of many u.s. veterans, comprised of many people of color and often subject to ageism, and who felt that a violent desecration of the u.s.flag violated their safe space and was an assault on their psyches.  what did the supreme court tell these vets  in tx v. johnson 1989?  deal with it.  look away if you dont like it.   you and the vets of color who made such arguments are one and the same. 					very nice put up, i actually love this website, keep on it 					Excellent letter. It appears a lot of the commentators here want the privilege of free speech without the consequences of pushback when they say homophobic (e.g. Matthew), racist or otherwise stupid statements.  It seems thats where the real whining is coming from. 					Its pretty obvious (and the comments show this) that this incident is widely seen as an example of how thoroughly bullying and totalitarian the supposedly hurt and victimized students in these confrontations are.  Vindictive Protectiveness, it has now very aptly been named. But I have to ask, why is this so prevalent now on the elite campuses in particular, like Yale. Of course this war on ideas prevents any honest debate about this at Yale or any of these other places. But affirmative action has to be counted as one factor. A t the most elite institutions now we are most likely to see a sizable group who have been admitted one or two levels above their own abilities. Its no wonder they have the nutty idea a college is supposed to be a safe home for them instead of the place to push and challenge them to get out and get moving. However, I do not think it can all by chalked up to affirmative action. A far wider spirit of fear of ideas and terror of discomfort is now endemic. It seems to be coming from the entire culture now  which weirdly combines a prissy sensitivity to any slight with the rawest mean-spirited styles in politics, the blogs, talk radio,  music, etc. Both left and right. Houston, weve got a problem. 					I cant believe this is coming out of an institution as highly regarded as Yale University.  Supporting free speech, freedom of expression, and dissenting opinions is not the same as agreeing with or encouraging offensive or racist views.  College is not a safe space, it is a place to learn and grow intellectually.  If youre so fragile that a costume makes you unable to learn, take a gap year and come back later. 					If you dont like it, you dont have to look away.  But you do have to understand that nobody is obliged to ensure that you arent offended. Cry out, yell about it, talk to the person that is wearing it and explain your point of view if it is truly that important to you. But dont you dare try to punish people for disagreeing with you.  THAT is oppression.  Grow up. 					Using the logic of these offended students, I and my fellow white classmates at Yale in the early 70s should have demanded that the university not permit the Black Panthers to occupy our campus because their presence and revolutionary rhetoric would offend our own delicate sensibilities. Instead, the entire Yale community closed up shop and ended the academic year several weeks early so that the Panthers could be accommodated. How pathetically far the university and its weak kneed students have fallen. 					Father of SC 19 					So you received an opposing view to your pre-hallween cautions and suggestions. And instead of saying heyyyy lets do this face to face, you escalate the situation and gather signatures. 					This is the heart of it: The real coddling is telling the privileged majority on campus that they do not have to engage with . . . brutal pasts. I was a member of the privileged majority at Yale as a student twenty years ago, and I was often ashamed of Yales disinterest in critical self-regardstarting with its incessant honorifics of John C. Calhoun and his ilk. This letters authors arent wrong that the names of slave owners and traders . . . adorn most of the buildings on campus.  These memorials arent maintained as provocation for critical engagement or edifices of free speech. They arent kept as teaching opportunities. Theyre maintained uncritically. Silently. Stupidly.  What must it be like to be a young student of color assigned to Calhoun College? Welcome to your new home, a space with which weyour teachers and mentorshave decided to honor an alumnus who wouldve bought and sold you, your parents, your children in chattel slavery. I cant believe people prefer to defend such noxiousness and outright stupidity as tough breaks or the real world. The world is what we make itmore specifically, what we inspire and provoke young people to do with it! Why not start with some intellectual honesty and ask: how does Yales persistent and uncritical pride in figures like John C. Calhoun inflect its future? And we shouldnt stop with the name over the doorwhy not ask how Yales administration and faculty continue to be overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male? Why not explore the implications of eurocentrism in the curriculum? I wish my classmates and I, 20 years ago, had been as thoughtful, as articulate, and *gutsy* as these students are, now.  If you truly care about free speech, then you should be *very* pleased to see young people asking bold, insightful questions of those in power.   And anyway: no one is asking Yale to stifle free speech or free engagement of ideas, however worthless or noxious they may be. No one is asking Yale to coddle anyone. This letter is asking the privileged majority in power at Yale to *stop* coddling itselfto take a good long look in the mirror, to think carefully, and to take responsibility for some big, long-standing mistakes. 					I think what is going on when white students make their costume a minority race or culture is that they are implicitly stating that the other race or culture is so other, so not normal, that it constitues fair game for a Halloween costume.  Thats the offensiveness of the message.  But that doesnt mean there is no right to dress as one wishes.   But it is offensive.  Some basic reviews of principals are in order.   The first amendment applies to Congress (Congress shall make no law).  Private parties within society are free to make rules of tolerable speech and apply whatever (lawful) consequences to infractions that they may choose, including disassociation, ostracism, etc.   And that includes universities.  A private university may impose rules of speech or conduct that the government could not.   So the original guidance email from the administration was certainly lawful.   Of course traditionally universities have essentially voluntarily and as a matter of ideals and academic freedom apllied free speech values to themselves as a core, if not the core, value.   So what is happening here is a renegotiation of that core value.   Culture changes, values change.  I imagine that on campus in the 1800s speech was not so free by todays standards.   And that, for example, simple incivilty and perceived lack of manners or even challenges directed to faculty might have led to consequences, including expulsion.  (I dont know that, but it seems plausible.) That all said, I wish students could lighten up a bit, and also maybe make common cause with each other, in the spirit of crosscultural tolerance and free speech.   Why doesnt a group of open-minded students get together next year and cross-dress and wander the campus parties togethera black student in white-face, and vice versa, a muslim student dressed as a priest, a jewish student in a turban and a christian student dressed in chasidic garb, a man as a women and vice versa, a vegan as a hunter and a jock as a ballerina, etc., use your imagination.   If you all walked together it might be a strong expression of solidarity.   It might be fun and educational to spend a few hours in another persons clothes or skin.   It might be a blast.  Just a thought.        by Fernando Torres With crime rates as high as 40,000 crimes+ per year, the Bronx in the 1990’s was not a safe place to live. Ugonna Eze, PC ’16, recalls not being able to walk safely through the streets without the fear of getting shot at or getting caught in the middle of gang warfare. As the son of immigrants, Ugonna’s parents searched for a way to improve their son’s life, and for them that meant relying on their local community and charter school system. While living in the Bronx, Ugonna was amazed to see that the crime and inequality problems weren’t solved by government policies, but rather handled by its community members. In an interview with DOWN, he recalled the hard work of the people at Bethany Chapel, who guided at-risk youths away from violence and gangs. Eze believes he can improve New Haven by uniting its residents, in the same way that the religious community guided the improvement of the Bronx. According to Eze, this same community experience also assisted the formation of one of his strengths – that he can personally relate to many of the people who live in New Haven. Many of the issues that he sees today are the same issues that he faced growing up: poverty, inequality, crime rates, education gaps, and homelessness. “There’s this misconception of homelessness as a statistic or abstract idea,” Ugonna told a group of supporters. “These are men, women, boys, and girls no different than you and I.” He stressed the importance of helping “our neighbors,” and it’s this type of language of unity that Ugonna is more than ready to spread. This emphasis on community is why Ugonna is running as a Republican; he believes that Democrats, “take the minority vote for granted.” “This is something that everyone can get involved with,” said campaign supporter Mollie Johnson BR’18, “It’s welcoming, opening, and inclusive.” This bipartisan campaign is something that Eze believes will allow him to hear all sides of the political spectrum, ensuring that he can grow as a candidate. Eze grew up relying on his community, and it is that same sentiment that he believes will help solve many of the problems in New Haven. The relationships she’s been able to cultivate in the city over her two terms are a great asset, she said.        by Arturo Pineda  Dear random white stranger, Scenario 1 I have a Yale hoodie on and you see it.  I smile to let you know I am friendly.  You reciprocate the friendliness and you smile back.  We walk past each other and the night goes on. Scenario 2 I do not have a Yale hoodie on.  I smile to let you know that I am friendly.  You do not reciprocate the friendless and you do not smile back. Instead, you cross the street to the other sidewalk. You don’t think I notice your behavior but I do. I notice that you don’t cross the street when there was a young white college student in front of me. I notice that you cross back to the same side of the street when we are far enough apart. I notice that you don’t even make eye contact with me. What did you notice about me? That my skin was an unsettling caramel color.  That I had an obscure hoodie covering part of my face.  That I was a potential threat to your too precious well-being. Here is what you did not notice about me. You did not notice I was a HUMAN BEING. You bluntly reinforced the stereotype that colored skin is a threat to your well-being simply by changing the direction you walked in. Your path isn’t one track but your mind is. I will continue on my lone journey down the sidewalk with my thoughts. I cannot approach you ask, “why did you cross the street when you saw me?” I can only hope that one day you will smile back.  I still have time here so we’ll see what happens. See you next week. A person of color        by Ishrat Mannan  In 2011 the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Jason Kenney who is currently Canada’s Minister of National Defense and Multiculturalism, introduced the ban on niqabs, a piece of cloth used to cover a Muslim womans face. Kenney along with the past Prime Minister of Stephen Harper justified the ban by claiming that it “protects women from violence” and that the women who wear them are “offensive.” In one broad stroke, the legislation passed sweeping generalizations of violence being uniquely inherent to a religious community while vilifying women who make the choice to wear a niqab.   The misogynistic focus and desire to control Canadian women’s clothing has prompted the mocking of the conservative government from Twitter.     Twitter, however, also became a space to spark a different conversation with this ban and Muslim women in mind. Inuit women created a hashtag “#DoIMatterNow which involved putting on makeshift niqabs to draw attention to the systematic disenfranchisement of Native people and to express solidarity with Muslim women affected by Harper’s policy.  The campaign’s manifesto explains:  “Indigenous women are fighting for the right to be safe and in control of our own bodies, and instead of launching an inquiry to uncover the systemic racism that caused an epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women, Harper attacks our Muslim sisters for what they choose to wear.  PM Harper, its my body, my clothing, and MY decision. You will not distract me from issues that actually matter to me as a Canadian. In solidarity with our Muslim sisters.        When Harper was asked to draw greater attention to the plight of missing and murdered indigenous women (MMIW) he responded by claiming that “most of these murders, sad as they are, are in fact solved.” This statement starkly contrasts with a 2014 RCMP report that says 1,107 Aboriginal women were murdered and another 164 went missing between 1980 and 2012, and of those cases 106 murder and 98 missing cases are unsolved.” The sheer disproportionality of MMIW rates are not unique to Canada, the US has rates that more than 1 in 3 Native women will face sexual assault. These rates do not appear, they are the result and process of centuries of discrimination.  This campaign within the Twitter-sphere is the manifested desire to shift the national and media attention surrounding Canadian women.  Besides being able to highlight Indigenous and Muslim women’s oppression under both systematic and political structures, this particular campaign also tries to draw both of these issues into the same conversation. Drawing visibility to a communitys’ pain is a tiring ask because it forces people to plea for their humanity in the same breath. To ask you to care.  These two communities, while ultimately seeking justice, are aiming for different responses from the Canadian government and society. Muslim women are calling for loyalty, citizenship, and freedom to dress how they choose to and not be under attack by a patriarchal society while Indigenous women are asking for a more responsible and active state engagement in aiding their community with gender biased violence.  The distinct goals of these two communities does not limit the opportunity for solidarity. Acts of solidarity must work to further the causes of a community and this particular campaign was a wonderful example of the manner in which other communities’ struggles can and should be addressed by all. We should ask ourselves how acts of solidarity should echo the voices, causes, and goals of the group that are in need of support.  &nbsp;        by Taylor Eldridge  There has been a fundamental misunderstanding on campus this past week. Specifically, the idea that freedom of speech means that there are no consequences for what someone decides to say. Freedom of speech is certainly critical to a healthy and diverse society, yet that does not preclude anyone from an investigation of the content, intention, and impact of their speech. The problem with the Yale administrations silent response to the concerns, particularly pertaining to women of color, about the racial climate on campus is that it is a refusal to acknowledge the repercussions of the freely expressed values of some members of the Yale community. What needs to be investigated, and urgently so, is the role that compassion serves in supporting the freedom of expression and the protection of students from marginalized communities. But what exactly does it mean when someone in our community says that they have been hurt by the actions of another community member, and our community’s official response is silence? Why has the support of free-to-be-offensive speech failed to account for the ways that the ways that the speech of wealthy white communities has been privileged over the voices of others, both historically and in present day? Why have influential Yale professors failed to invite a compassionate response to the concerns of all community members with the same diligence that they have strived to defend a student’s right to be offensive? Acknowledging another persons hurt, and partnering with them to find ways to demonstrate that their presence is valued is what happens in healthy communities. Yet, the cynicism on campus has left no room for compassion. To acknowledge another person’s pain and why people continue causing it is hard; to be compassionate is to stretch yourself beyond the limits of your own experience, and extend dignity and worth to an experience that is not your own. Yale does not exist in a vacuum; racism and the dehumanization of Black and Brown folks are just as flagrant between the four walls of each of the residential colleges as it is in any city that has made headlines in the past year. Simply because you have not personally experienced racism at Yale or out in the world does not disprove its presence. We need to learn a new math that teaches us that one Yalie’s positive experience doesnt cancel out or provide an excuse to hide or ignore another one’s negative experience; that the concerns of students of color at Yale prompts an equal response as that given to a threat to the freedom of expression. Our community, the Yale administration included, has a responsibility to care for communities of color that were just welcomed to campus 50 years ago. It is only when the experiences of students of color are met with the same vigorous support of “free speech” that Yale can grow into the inclusive community it claims to be. &nbsp; 					Regarding the administrative response action step #1: Forcing SAE to admit their guilt in this particular scenario is an unfair demand. The idea of forcing self-incrimination goes against the fifth amendment of the constitution and basically sets a precedent for mob rule. However, the fact that the accusations were made and the subsequent response is evidence that there are harmful dynamics at play here, and both SAE and the administration should admit that. Regarding Administrative Initiative action step #5: At the very least, students should be allowed to credit/D these courses since they are outside of most Yale students typical class experiences. Additionally, exceptions must be made for students with double majors who have little room as-is for elective courses. Requiring students to study classes in these particular majors seems like an overstep of administrative power. No classes are required in any other specific major, only certain skill areas. Regarding student input #1: Allowing for student input should not be confused with allowing students to make the final decisions on faculty hiring. While it is important to consider student feelings when choosing faculty, the tenure of a professor often lasts well beyond the graduation date of a given student. Therefore, the administration should listen to student input but ultimately have the final say in these matters, even if it is in opposition to student opinions. Student input #3: The removal of the master and associate master from Silliman must be justified by a reason other than just expressing an unpopular opinion. If the email sent by the associate master is used as justification to remove them from the college, it will set a precedent for other masters to be removed for holding similarly unpopular opinions. For example, the master of Calhoun who argued in favor of keeping the name Calhoun College could be removed on the basis of this opinion. Additionally, a college master who speaks in favor of retaining the title of master could also be removed based on the unpopularity of this opinion. Everything else looks pretty good though 					I agree with the above. 					So, despite the fact that departments such as Computer Science are criminally understaffed, you want to divert a ton of money to this stuff? Thats not even including the ridiculous core classes requirement thats on there. And you want SAE to be forced to apologize for something that probably didnt happen, and be treated like a bunch of middle schoolers by having to write an essay? I agree that Yale can improve on some of this, but most of this list is completely insane. 					There are a few core issues here, and its mostly based in the inefficient and bureaucratic administrative policies at universities. Theres just no way youre going to get a response in 24 hours from the President on issues as sensitive as these. However, if you can establish a race issue- centric body within the administration similar to the UWC, then perhaps you have a place to start. Keep in mind: the UWC is part of Yales slow, bureaucratic administration that makes its moves slowly.  Just some more background on what previous comments have pointed out: the university lost its control over fraternities and other off campus organizations when it cut ties and removed these organizations from campus. Translation: Yale has no power over an organization they are not affiliated with, especially when they can only work with allegations rather than fact. 					I absolutely agree with these demands. I personally have not taken any class in the AFAM or ER;M departments, and its about time that I did. Its an absolute shame that its taken me until this many hearts have been poured out before me for me to realize how important it is that I am educated in these subjects. If all of Yale were required to take classes in these departments, I think that the awful events of this past week may have been avoided. 					You know, I think what it comes down to is it feels a lot worse to be black in America than a decade ago with what has happened and what you see on mass media.  Even with a black POTUS, you see the Republicans disrespecting the Presidency like never before.  I cant imagine what it does to the psyche of these kids.  This is the divide between what I think the reactions should be and what the reactions actually are in terms of the proposed solutions.  I cant claim to understand the pain, even as a gay Asian alum who loved my experience at Yale.        by Elizabeth Spenst  Last year, I wrote an essay for an English class about the health effects of racism on the Black body, from Johny Henryism to microagressions to the racial empathy gap. I supported everything I wrote with medical studies and research, like any scholar would. When I read through the comments that my classmates wrote to help improve my first draft, one white man suggested that I “tone down the rhetoric.” I was not making a rhetorical move, I was telling the factual, empirical truth. He has probably forgotten about writing that comment, and he has probably forgotten about my essay too. But whenever the systemic racism embedded in Yale’s culture is brought to life and whenever people start to defend their misinformed opinions with cries of free speech, I think about the moment when I wrote a factual, researched essay about the harm of everyday racism on the Black body and a white man decided that the part about Black pain wasn’t working for him. My former classmate and I are living in two different worlds right now. His world is still spinning, while mine is duct taped to its crumbling axis and desperately in need of repair. My world, and the world of a few hundred Yalies has been shaken by the offensive email sent out by Associate Head of Silliman College Erika Christakis the night before Halloween, followed by the incident on Halloween when Black women were denied entry to an SAE party because the fraternity brothers told them that it was “white girls only.” And of course we are not surprised. So few of my professors, administrators, and fellow students look like me. Mainstream media tells the nation that we are oversensitive or underserving of our spots at schools like Yale. Who would have taught Christakis or the SAE brothers how to treat women of color with respect? SAE is almost not worth mentioning at all. When DOWN published a weekend survival guide back in September, we warned students of color not to feel worthless when SAE brothers don’t hit on them because they’re not white. Based on the flood of personal horror stories that women of color have shared about treatment at SAE, we should have warned people not to go there at all. Christakis called for an open conversation between students on offensive costumes, and on the surface, she got what she wanted (cause we’re sure as hell talking), but in reality this intellectual exercise came at the expense of Native students’ emotional health and even physical safety. Framing this as a debate forces people of color to educate unwilling white people and place themselves in harm’s way. The SAE discussion has just boiled down to an “It happened” vs. an “It didn’t happen” discourse. They are just denying it (probably for legal reasons). And the LITERAL FACTS as recounted by several women of color are politicized such that people who support SAE (or disagree with this, whatever that means) are saying the women are liars. How can you disagree with facts? Both SAE and Christakis use a rationalistic logic that’s actually highly afactual and irrational because—you guessed it—they’re racist! This kind of racism in disguise – where a false debate about “free speech” is used to question people of color’s humanity – needs to stop. And that’s why this is not an op-ed. I’m not writing about my opinion, I’m writing about my humanity. There is a terrible gap in understanding that is impeding conversations about racism on campus. A lot of people don’t understand what racism is and why the feelings and experiences of people of color are just as valid as those of white people. To understand this, I would have to explain a lot of history and theory. But I am tired. All of the people of color who have been speaking out for the past few days are tired as well. It takes great emotional labor to justify my humanity over and over again because the stakes are so high. My life is at stake. When white people engage in a dialogue about race, they can walk away at the end, regardless of the conclusion or outcome. We can’t. This is the situation we face in a country that was founded on slavery, genocide, and conditional free speech. If you think that these three things have nothing to do with our present conversation, then you are misinformed. If you disagree with anything I previously said, come to the Afro-American Cultural Center when I’m on duty in the staff office. I’ll have a conversation with you about race while I’m on the clock and being paid; you are not entitled to my emotional capital. I have to start turning in my class assignments on time again. I have to stop waking up everyday feeling sad, and then angry. All of my people of color need to start taking care of themselves, and healing. We need Yale to pay for mandatory racial sensitivity programs for students, professors, and administrators. This is essential for the mental and emotional wellbeing of students of color on campus. Until Yale gives me a salary, health insurance, and a parking spot, I cannot be a full-time educator on this campus. I need to be ensured that my humanity is never again treated as a matter of opinion. 					Would love to talk and have an intelligent conversation. 					as a woman of color, though a woc who does not always face the same issues in the same ways as Black women, this is so powerful. thank you and please continue to speak truth. 					I love this. Thank you, Liz 					Elizabeth, Let me begin by saying that I think your piece is well written and I write as a former student who read the email (I will only refer to the email, and not the SAE incident). I didnt find the email offensive for this reason: I firmly believe it was an honest defense of the first amendment. Before you tune me out immediately, please know that I would genuinely and sincerely like to discuss if you are willing, because I know my opinion is similar to many that did not find the email objectionable. I do not think the administration penalizing offensive students is appropriate because I do not think it will address or change deep-rooted racism, there is a lot of ambiguity in what is offensive, and lastly, because it is extremely dangerous to punish someone solely due to the fact that they are despicable and offensive. I would find many Halloween costumes extremely offensive and objectionable if those costumes belittled an entire group of people. However, the reason why this is a freedom of speech issue is because you MUST defend that which you find objectionable, otherwise, by definition, it isnt freedom of speech at all. If someone dresses up as a suicide bomber or wears blackface, its remarkably despicable, but I believe that you have to defend the right to do so. There should be serious social consequences for acting in that sort of manner, and those consequences gain momentum and significance every year. I support the Associate Masters belief that students are capable to make those decisions. Best, 					Married to a dark skined husband, raising 2 dark skined children ; I fear for their safty and them getting emotionally  abused every day. 					Thank you for saying (writing) what needed to be said out loud. Im a Black American woman working on Yales campus and my sister graduated from Yale two years ago. Between my three sisters and I, we have nine college degrees. Four from Ivys. We have experienced both the open and the micro aggression style racism on campus. Its real and its emotionally and (increasingly) physically dangerous. However, the best revenge is living well. And the best bleach is sunlight. Continue your studies, keep educating on your own terms. Also make sure you continue your selfcare (ie having healthy boundaries and such). You will continue to do big things. All the best to you. Im proud like I know you! 					This is beautiful, and you are strong, and there are people fighting alongside you. 					You are so admirable, Elizabeth  in every way. So glad I met and know you 					Very powerful  thank you Liz 					Please keep being strong and keep fighting to help people understand, no matter how hard it is. I am trying to do the same, and my heart goes out to those who have more at stake than I do. 					thank you thank you thank you for these words.        by Nicole Chavez On Saturday, October 31st at the Afro American Cultural Center, a group of thirty students discussed sex over lunch. The workshop titled Race, Ethnicity, Culture, and Sexuality, was one of several discussions hosted during Sex and Sexuality Week. The goal of the series of workshops and performances was to promote a sex-positive, safe, and inclusive space …. to facilitate honest, intersectional discussion about the nuances of sexual wellness, politics, and pleasure within the Yale community. The Afro American Cultural Center served as a safe space where, with the guidance of SeLF facilitators, intimate conversations opened up quickly. Many students wrongfully assume that Yale has a campus climate that is open and accepting of sex. Despite its reputation for having a thriving hook-up culture, Yale students do not put forth enough effort to actually discuss sexuality and the implications it has on campus. Fortunately, this workshop created a space in which students could actively discuss their thoughts and concerns about how Yale students express their sexuality. Small groups consisting of about seven to eight students each gathered around a table and had a two hour long conversation during which they discussed the ways in which race, ethnicity, gender, and culture have impacted the quality of their relationships at Yale  whether they be platonic friendships, steamy hookups, or monogamous dating. Conversations turned to a variety of topics including whether or not racial preferences in dating and hookups is inherently racist, how ones racial and ethnic identity may induce or exacerbate internalized homophobia, and exploring ways in which the intersection of race and sexuality can be brought into conversation with our peers and partners more frequently. Throughout the session, students were asked to write anonymous responses to a series of prompts that encouraged them to reflect on how their racial and ethnic identities affected their past relationships and their attitude towards seeking relationships in the future. Some of the prompts included whether or not students typically date individuals of one particular racial and/or ethnic group only, whether they see their racial identity as playing a prominent and openly discussed role in their relationships, and if they felt people of color are actively discriminated against in the dating and hookup scenes at Yale. These conversations were led by several Sexual Literacy Forum (SeLF) facilitators. SeLF is a program through which undergraduates passionate about sexual education can lead workshops that resolve the misconceptions surrounding sexuality. Facilitators focus on promoting the physical and emotional wellbeing of ones self and ones partner(s). As one SeLF facilitator stated during the workshop You can only have a healthy relationship with someone when you know where they are coming from. Getting a better grasp of your partners background and the way it influences their thoughts and feelings towards sex and sexuality is crucial to maintaining a mutually healthy relationship. For those students who are interested in joining similar in-depth conversations on sexuality, SeLF teaches semester-long seminars on sexuality to undergraduates. The 10-week course covers a variety of topics including sexual orientation, gender, desire, body images, and safe sexual practices.

Buckley conference on the freedom of the speech. The post states, “’Looking at the reaction to Erika Christakiss email, you would have thought someone wiped out an entire Indian village!’” According that post, this “joke” was met with laughter. Almost immediately, the Native American undergraduate community responded, mobilizing via GroupMe, and stood outside the doors of LC 102. Security guards and police officers stood outside every entrance, denying students of color for the the sake of “maintaining the peace. As POC began to crowd the hallways, some Native students, specifically Native women, spoke out against the remarks posted on Facebook. With the company of Black, Latinx, Asian American, and other marginalized students, the Native women sang in unison, and their voices reverberated with the thunderous claps of those who stood in solidarity with them. They were exercising THEIR freedom to speech. At one point an attendee of the conference exited the room and began arguing with the women of color in front of him. The exchange dissolved with the student attendees of the conference leaving in frustration. After about half an hour, students continued crowding the hallways of LC, making posters, and lining up at every entrance to the building. As the conference ended, the attendees were met with POC gathered with posters which overwhelmingly beared the words “GENOCIDE IS NOT A JOKE.” Some ignored the chants and posters, and others arrogantly confronted the students, taking selfies with their posters held up high and laughing at their presence. The students responded with louder chants, crying for them to “walk away with their privilege.” As the building emptied, the Native students stayed and reflected, thankful for the solidarity of other POC. Everyone present gathered in unison, chanting “We out here. We been here. We ain’t leaving. We are loved.”        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon There are too many problems in Erika Christakis’ Halloween email for me to name, so I will not try. Instead, I want to draw your attention to one glaring problem that has been sadly, criminally overlooked. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE OF FEELINGS. To avoid any confusion, let me qualify this statement. Under no circumstances do I mean to invalidate the emotional responses of POC students on this campus, and in particular of women of color. Nor do I mean to support the bullshit tone policing of patriarchal and white supremacist voices on campus that demand students of color dress their pain, anger, and frustration up in nice academic phrases, preferably name-dropping Foucault and other reputable dead white people. It is NOT the job of students of color to make this conversation easy for you, especially since even just initiating conversation—whether through demonstrations on Cross Campus, or by offering to educate—demands that students of color put the sacred truth that is their identity and personal experience up for general debate. No, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is that even for you assholes who, like me, believe that intellect and emotion can be separate—even for those among you (myself not included) who discount the emotional responses of POC students as excessive or self-indulgent, or who believe that offense is a natural part of productive academic discourse… Even you must recognize that cultural appropriation is wrong. Let me illustrate by way of analogy. I once had a good White friend who believed he could use the word nigger as long as his audience was completely white. He didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But does this sound right? Intuitively, we know it fucking doesn’t, which suggests that White usage of the n-word must be terribly and invariably wrong. Bingo. It’s never okay because it invokes histories of slavery and oppression, and plays directly into systems of White hegemony that endure to this day. Similarly, even when no one ethnic is around to see some lame-ass headdress or “Mexican” costume, or to cry angry tears at blackface and tell half-assed geishas to go to hell, the costume-wearer is still identifying with centuries of imperialists, fetishists, and exterminators—and laughing at the effects. That’s fucked up. And so while the feelings of people of color always deserve respect, there is another issue here: perpetuating the systems of oppression that POC students experience daily when they whiten themselves to survive, or are turned away from shitty frats, or learn whitewashed history, or grapple with sky-high rates of sexual assault is ALWAYS wrong. Inherently. Impartially. Objectively. The reason that there is a difference between the reactions to by Halloween Indians and the “offense taken by religiously conservative folks to skin-revealing costumes,” Ms. Christakis, is that religious people have never experienced systematic oppression indexed by aggressive onslaughts of immodesty. They do not shoulder institutionalized social disregard for their identity, or their intelligence, or their right to life itself. When you say, “Decent people have proposed guidelines on Halloween costumes from a spirit of avoiding hurt or offense,” you are dead wrong, because the IAC didn’t try to protect delicate feelings. It took a universally binding moral stand. Erika Christakis is not a categorically bad woman, but she invalidates the experiences of vast segments of the Yale community because her White privilege has convinced her that oppression is simple instances of one-on-one offense and insult. She is used to being treated as an individual. She is used to being uniquely heard. But we are not. We cannot be. Every day when we are treated as ugly monoliths, we have to learn to rely on each other and forge bonds through our communal pain. When society oppresses African-Americans, Caribbean-Americans, first-generation American Africans, and even students from the African continent indiscriminately, we create a network called Black people. When this campus ignores the daily struggles of the NACC, the AACC, La Casa, and the House, militant POC unity is born. We are not emotional reverse-racists; we are survivors. Fuck this, y’all. I’m out. 					FUCK YES. Thank you Alejandra. You are amazing. 					This is too dope. Thank you.        by Christian White  Dear Associate Master Christakis, My name is Christian White and I’m a sophomore in Silliman College, a space I’d like to think you’ve made yourself familiar with. Let me begin by saying that I don’t know you and I’ve never met you, even though we reside in the same space. With that being said, I don’t know what kind of person you are, your background or your views, but I’d like to extend to you the benefit of the doubt by assuming that you are a genuine and true person and that you’re intentions all fall in the boundary of good meaning. You seem like a truly educated woman, who is extremely knowledgeable about her field. So as a student in your college, and a student of color, I feel it is my obligation to educate you, and reveal the holes in the arguments that you made in your email. In your words, “we want to be in the business of encouraging the exercise of imagination, not constraining it.” You use this to suggest that children should not be limited in their choice of costumes, be it offensive or not, because they have the right to exercise their creativity. But at what point do we sacrifice the respect to different cultures, religions, and ethnicities for the sake of allowing imagination to foster? At what point do we deem creativity a sufficient reason to disrespect the authenticity of different cultures? I find it disturbing that you would imply forfeiting basic respect to people of different backgrounds in the name of creativity is acceptable in this day and age. By this logic, you suggest that if one of your preschool students wanted to dress up in black face and be the princess Tiana you mentioned before, that you have no qualms with allowing her to do so. You proceed to ask in your letter, “Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious… a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?” No, there is absolutely not any room. I don’t know how old you are, or what era you grew up in, but in this day and age there is downright no room to justify being outwardly offensive, inappropriate, or simply ignorant in a way that makes others feel uncomfortable. Dean Howard’s carefully articulated letter to the student body suggested that we carefully consider our choice of dress. In your letter you say that this “censure and prohibition from above” is somewhat patronizing to the student body, that it suggests that we don’t have the capacity to make proper decisions regarding appropriate dress. I find that you have deeply mistaken the intentions of the university administration. You’re right, we’re all adults, regardless of how mature or immature we are. We are all highly educated adults interacting in a multifaceted community. So why did the administration feel the need to encourage students to think twice? Because clearly some of the highly educated adults within this community can be as bigoted, as ignorant, as narrow-minded as someone not of their capabilities. Within our community there are those that have the “capacity” to make proper decisions but disregard them due to their own obliviousness. Associate Master Christakis, I must conjecture that you are of the same oblivious nature. That you don’t understand the bigotry these “adults” are capable of, that you do not acknowledge the disrespect and genuine hurt felt by the cultures appropriated. Associate Master Christakis, maybe the most disturbing piece of your argument comes from your attempts to compare our student body to the preschoolers you are so accustomed to. Your attempt to extend your expertise a little further past the age gap simply doesn’t suffice. I know you must be quite knowledgeable in regards to younger children, but as you said, we are “young adults” who are fundamentally different in how we perceive, interpret, and interact with different things. However, what irritates me more is how you trivialize the concerns of those appropriated by constraining this situation to the boundaries of preschoolers. I would hope that parents would have the decency to not allow their children to be openly offensive and culturally insensitive. But as young adults, we are not under the constant supervision of our parents, we must have the ability for ourselves to know when we have crossed the line of appropriation. This is exactly why we have to have this conversation, because some of us do not have this ability, some of us act as if we still need the constant supervision of parents. While reading your letter, I couldn’t help but feel disappointed and frustrated by your lack of validation on this matter. Dean Howard’s suggestions to be wary of our costume choices were well articulated and appropriately timed. For you as neither a dean or a master of this college to respond to his suggestions in the way you did was unjustified, excessive, and frankly unnecessary. As a student of color in your residential college, I was very disappointed that somebody in your position was capable of alienating the sense of community we try so hard to build in Silliman. I was so disheartened that somebody meant to make us feel more comfortable at Yale can so easily perpetuate primitive ideas that continue to percolate our society. I was surprised that somebody could have the audacity to trivialize our issues and tell us to “look away” if we’re offended. During my time at Yale, I’ve tried so hard to set my expectations high for our faculty and administration, hoping that they would be enlightened enough to effectively listen to and help us deal with our concerns. However, after reading your letter, I find my standards are still a little too high. Finally in your conclusion you ask the question “What does this debate about Halloween costumes say about our view of young adults, of their strength and judgment?” I must say, that if this is your final question directed to this topic, after we have spent so much time examining and debating the issue, then you have completely missed the point of this whole discussion. This is not about the administration’s viewpoint of the student body as young people, this is not about the administration attempting to limit our freedom of expression, and this damn sure is not about your “problem child concept.” This whole discussion is about having the basic decency to show respect and understanding to all those ethnicities, religions, and cultures that have been so oft disrespected in the past. This is about being a responsible and culturally aware member of society, regardless of whether you are a child, young adult, or senior citizen. As citizens, especially those in such an elite and elevated community as Yale, we have an obligation to produce culturally responsible, educated people ready to contribute to the world. How can we, as an institution, do that if we don’t have the affability to encourage students to make proper decisions about their dress. So to address your final statement, you are right, it is not your business to directly control the costumes of young people. But you especially as a figure of authority, whose job is to make your students feel comfortable in their respective communities, have a duty to encourage people to think twice about their costume decisions. When we are young Halloween is all about collecting candy and dressing up as monsters. But, as we get older we realize the real monsters don’t have to dress up to be one. 					This is beautiful &lt;3 					I am an undergraduate female student of color from the University of Michigan and I stand in solidarity with you all. Love.        by Treston Codrington It would be foolish to say that right now, women of color are coming under attack. This has been their existence for centuries. Let us think back to the Africans who became playthings of the European kidnappers or the Native American women who enjoyed equality and even power in their clans but were disrespected and removed from their positions because the white man demanded to talk to a man. Fast forward to the late 19th century to behold African-American women, freed from physical chains but still bound to their status as servants and their bodies as exotic fetishes. Enter the Asian immigrant woman and the immediate obsession with fetishizing her as submissive. Look at talented Native women like Dr. Susan La Flesche Picotte who spent a great deal of her life pushing the needs of her people aside and adopting humiliating positions just to be accepted by the (white) women’s suffrage movement. Or consider Madame C. J. Walker, the first American female millionaire (black or white) who was an amazing woman, entrepreneur, and civil rights activist. But what was her fortune built on? Hair products. Not just any hair products, but hair products that would help black women get as close to the white standard of beauty as possible. Fast forward again to the 1960s and 70s. Black women took the chance of embracing themselves, flaunting their lovely kinks and coils that God graciously crowned their heads with, but they were told they looked “unprofessional. Look at the pop culture of today and see historical stereotypes repeating themselves. Black women are the sassy, dangerous ones. Latina women are the talkative, feisty ones. Asian women are the mysterious, submissive ones. And Native women? Well, they aren’t represented at all! Look to government statistics of the 21st century. See how women of color suffer disproportionately from disenfranchisement and inequality than what white women suffer. More unequal pay, less paid sick leave, more discrimination in health care (somewhat targeted by the hated Affordable Care Act), and more of the brunt of “zero tolerance” policies. Look at the universities. See how the places of higher learning, the grooming grounds for the future leaders of the world are microcosms of the greater system of disenfranchisement and abuse. Look into the history of exclusion of people from color in Greek life. Read the manifestos of sorority girls explaining why Black women aren’t given bids (because they are ‘aesthetically unpleasing to the eye’ and they ‘don’t deserve to be at [the college] at all’—Southern Methodist University). Then on top of all that, they claim that Blacks are racist for creating their own sororities and fraternities. Listen to the stories of women of color on this campus. Listen to what they have been told they are. “Black bitch,” some say. Listen to Native women recount the times they have been verbally and physically accosted while their attackers donned the sacred headdresses of their people. And listen to how Latina women were asked for their passport in order to enter a party. Behold how difficult it is right now for women of color to be heard or believed. The burden of proof is always put on them. Listen to the icy retorts such as “There isn’t enough evidence to prove that” or “I don’t see the big deal here.” All over this campus, all over this country, men and women gaze apathetically. They refuse to try to understand. They refuse to listen. They believe these women lie and just made up this “fuss” over nothing. If only they would take a good look. This story has been bound and bubbling within the DNA of these women for centuries, and it has finally burst. *Tickets for For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When The Rainbow Isn’t Enuf have sold out. If you know a member of the cast, then reach out about attending the invited dress on Wednesday. It should be understood that this article need not and was not intended to apply only to this specific production. Rather, it is a call to action for all students to demand spaces and support for minority theater and other art making on this campus. This was originally published in Broad Recognition.         by Sarah Pearl Heard  “May I have your permission to excuse myself?” These words came from Yale’s first Black Dean Jonathan Holloway as he stepped down from the Women’s Table, visibly upset after giving an impromptu speech to a crowd of over two hundred students.  What had started as a chalking event by the Black Student Alliance at Yale turned into a open forum to discuss the past week’s events where many students questioned Dean Holloway’s absence directly.  Many students soon began to share their personal experiences in an effort to evoke action. One junior recalled an account that was relayed by her mother, stating that “You didn’t talk to Black people in high school, how do we know you’ll do right by us now?” She repeated this several times through sobs.  The crowd reacted with stunned silence and a few scattered snaps.  While many personal experiences and cries for help were recorded the crowd shifted to recounting stories of discrimination encountered in the classroom, and how these encounters had fostered a hostile learning environment for students of color.  Isaiah Genece lamented the lack of Black professors in STEM, and requested serious efforts for the diversification of faculty. Several other students of color described  their inability to lodge formal complaints against professors or students in their classes concerning  offensive and insensitive comments. Abdul-Razak Zachariah and another student both spoke about the difficulty of being the only male Black student in the Erika Christakis’s competitive seminar “The Concept of the Problem Child.” This upcoming lecture is about Black male youth in America.  Abdul acknowledged that while he perceived Professor Christakis to be a kind person, her level of unprofessionalism and assumed knowledge about experiences that are outside her realm of academia is unacceptable as a leader on campus.  Dean Holloway dutifully recorded notes and seemed on the verge of tears as he listened to all of the students’ lamentations. Some students such as Ron Trioche, asked for affirmation that he would “do better.” He assured the crowd that he would.  Though many of  the students were brought to tears or riled up to the point of shouting, many also left feeling empowered. Diana Orozco Ortega explained that “It [her time spent on Cross Campus] was one of the best experiences Ive had at Yale because I truly felt the community come together here. “As we know, women of color are especially vulnerable in these communities, and racism takes forms that go beyond just exclusion racism for a woman of color also means sexual harassment and assault as their bodies are fetitized and appropriated. Im glad that other women of color have shown solidarity and bravery by refusing to stay silent,and Im so glad that members of these communities of people of color have been so willing to listen to our experiences and be supportive.” Faculty of color have spoke out in support of students of color as well. Professor Jafari Allen said he has “Overwhelming pride for the sisters that spoke out incisive intelligence and courage and heart. With that combination we will not lose.” Lex Barlowe, president of the Black Student Alliance at Yale concluded the emotional three hour experience on Cross Campus with a chant that was also chalked in front of Sterling Memorial Library “ We out here. We been here. We ain’t leaving. We are loved.”         by Nicole Chavez  Last Thursday afternoon, a small group of students gathered in the Silliman Courtyard to chalk affirmations in support of women of color at Yale. This peaceful demonstration of solidarity and self-love was in response to Associate Master of Silliman College Erika Christakis’ email to students that challenged a previous email sent from the Intercultural Affairs Council advising students to respect students of color and not wear offensive costumes. The media has depicted ongoing events on campus as a “PC War” in which people of color are impeding other students and faculty from practicing their freedom of speech. What the Christakises and other adversaries of these student organizers fail to recognize is that their supposedly violated right to free speech is the same one students of color on campus have been vying on behalf of for decades. The supposed upsurge of student activism on campus is not an isolated event in Yale’s history. Students of color at Yale have always spoken their mind, representing “the cultivation of citizens with a rich awareness of [their] heritage” that is echoed in the College’s mission statement.  However, if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Likewise, if a student of color voices her concerns on campus and no one is around to hear it, does she even exist? Placid petitions for improvement have evolved into outspoken orders for reform as students’ voices have fallen relentlessly on the ears of bureaucrats. On Thursday, as students protested by chalking on the walkways of the Silliman courtyard, the Master of the college Nicholas Christakis encroached upon their demonstration. Christakis made it clear to the students that his intentions were never benign. Students accused him of addressing them in a condescending manner, reportedly making statements such as: “I’m so glad you’re exercising your right to free speech!” and “What is all this [chalking] for?” and “This is what happens when you read the Constitution.” As he talked at students, Christakis bent over and placed his hands on his knees, similar to a dog owner regarding his pet. Upon noting Christakis’ confrontational demeanor with individual students, passerbys gathered around to see what was occurring. Students claim that the severity of the situation quickly escalated as Christakis labeled the growing crowd of spectators a “mob.” Appeals were made by students for the Master of Silliman College to apologize for his behavior and the subsequent pain that permeated campus. In one publicly released video of the event, one student claims that student “opinions have been dismissed. You [Masters and Deans] have not said: ‘I’m here for you. I hear that you are hurting and I am sorry that I have caused you to feel pain.’” Christakis delivered what can scarcely be considered a half-hearted apology; he claims to feel remorse for disrespecting students, but still stands firmly by the validity of every word that caused the hurt. The Master of Silliman College seems to have faced difficulty demarcating the boundaries between his role as an as an educator who promotes intellectual discourse and his role as a college Master who is responsible “for the physical wellbeing and safety of students in the residential colleges.” During the encounter with students at the Silliman courtyard, students inquired at what point should free speech be censored. Firmly, he had responded that he “stand[s] for free speech … even when it denigrates [an individual].” Many students described Christakis’ commentary that afternoon as a sign of his stubborn refusal to even attempt to sympathize with students. He prioritizes the prospect of intellectual growth derived from prejudiced statements over the emotional scarring they induce in their targets. Sadly, Christakis is not alone in this belief, having the backing of Greg Lukianoff, founder of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) and author of the viral The Atlantic article “The Coddling of the American Mind.” The premise of Lukianoff’s article echoes Erika and Nicholas Christakis’ concern that campus cultures of political correctness have amplified the censorship of students’ opinions at the expense of intellectual enlightenment. At a Silliman’s Master Tea on Thursday night, after the courtyard incident, Lukianoff made it clear that the only free speech that should be censored is that which, by the Supreme Court’s standards, qualifies as harassment. Essentially, he said, this would entail only upsetting behavior that is repetitive and targeted towards a particular person. This definition ignores much of the hate speech directed towards students of color and other marginalized groups at Yale. Rather than hear repeated verbal assaults on their identity from a particular individual, many students are victim to hearing a multitude of disparaging statements made daily to their marginalized community. In the Silliman courtyard last Thursday afternoon, students’ urgently voiced their concerns about how disregarded prejudiced statements made by students – whether it be something as subtle as the microaggression “Where are you from?” to something as volatile as a first year student being called the n-word – cause the same psychological and emotional detriment as legally-defined harassment. In the publicly released video, a Silliman student calls Christakis out for not knowing her name and insinuates that it is because she is a person of color. She says that despite having taken a course with him her freshman year and attending office hours every week, despite him being her sophomore advisor, despite her being a part of a committee within her college, Christakis has yet to learn her name. In the video, she can be heard saying the following: “I live here … You should know my name. You have called me other names … Geraldine … Malika … Nina.” As Christakis rushed to point out in the crowd the other girls whose name the student mentioned, students applauded the fact that Christakis could finally get the name of some Black women straight. Another student, captured in an unreleased video of the encounter, has claimed that student efforts to create a dialogue with peers about ignorant and demeaning commentary made towards people of color are quickly silenced: “There are people who don’t respect us [even] when we try to have these conversations. It’s not like we’re not attempting to have these conversations. I am a senior. I have been trying to have these conversations with people since I’ve stepped foot onto this campus.” It is “disrespect for [her] very human being that” she feels here on this campus. Some media outlets have depicted Yale students as spoiled, privileged youth who have been made too uncomfortable to live in “safe heated buildings with two Steinway grand pianos, an indoor basketball court, a courtyard with hammocks and picnic tables” and more lavished furnishings. However, many of the student concerns have focused not on themselves, but rather on the wellbeing of first year students and potential students at Yale. Accusing Christakis for making Silliman feel insecure, one student shared her fear of lying to potential applicants: “I give tours every week and have to stand here in the courtyard and say: … ‘this is my home … I love my college.’ I can’t say that anymore. It is no longer a home. It is no longer a safe space.” Another student said she found it “incredibly depressing for the freshman who are [on campus] now and who don’t know any better. Who don’t know that [Yale] was once a space that [she] was proud to be a part of.” It is true, campus is no longer – and has really never been – a safe space for students of color. This is true not just for students’ hurt by Christakis’ comments, but also for students who are voicing their opinions and sharing their stories at student protests now. Students’ free speech and safety are being compromised by the adults who are claiming to whole heartedly support this right to speak one’s mind. The videos released to the public of students with Christakis in the Silliman Courtyard was released without the consent of the students depicted in these recordings. The individual who originally uploaded these videos was in fact Greg Lukianoff, the free speech enthusiast, who uploaded the videos onto FIRE’s Youtube Channel. One example of the disastrous consequence of Lukianoff’s behavior, is the attention it brought to the one young woman caught shouting “Who the fuck hired you?” at Christakis. This video has circulated rapidly, getting more than 860,000 views in just five days. The young woman in the video, now known online as the “Shrieking Girl,” has received numerous deaths threats from individuals who have watched the video. This is because much of her personal information, such as her name, home address, parents’ names, have been divulged online. The student has been forced to delete her online presence in order to seek refuge from the unwarranted hate. Lukianoff’s rash and legally questionable actions are a threat to the freedom of speech and wellbeing of students of color on campus who do not want to be the next victim of violent and relentless racists on the internet. 					Thanks for sharing this. Im an alum (CC 85) and am deeply grieved that weve made so little progress on dismantling racism at Yale since then. Please pass on my support and respect for the woman in the video  her attempt to get through to Christakis moved me to tears. I want her to know that there are people out here who applaud her for her courage, honesty and integrity.        See the signatories here To the Yale Community:  Recent on-campus events and related discussions between students and administrators highlight the longstanding and institutionalized inequalities that exist at our university. This history and its complex legacies will only be dispelled by critique, social commitment, and hard work at many levels of policy and practice. Calls for greater diversity do not by themselves resolve the experience of racism and devaluation, and maintaining silence about racial inequality on campus only exacerbates the problem. It is not for students alone to shoulder the many burdens of this work.  We, the undersigned members of the Yale faculty, affirm our commitment to creating an educational environment in which all students are able to thrive. We acknowledge that we have not yet collectively realized this central educational goal, nor have we fully recognized the vital contribution of faculty and students who are doing transformative scholarship on the histories and cultures of unrepresented and under-represented communities. We will continue to work with students, administrators, and our faculty colleagues to make Yale a place that respects and values all students and faculty of color. 					Please add my name to the signatories!        by Sarah Pearl Heard  “This not the Yale we chose. Give us the Yale we chose. We traveled thousands of miles to be here and we deserve that.”  These were the words of Nodumo Ncomanzi, a senior from Zimbabwe, as she spoke on behalf of the Yale African Students Association (YASA) and international students from other countries that students of color at Yale call home. Before her, a sophomore named  Ivetty Estepan who is of Dominican descent and identifies with both La Casa and the Afro-American Cultural Houses gave a rousing speech.  In it she declared, “We are not victims. We are on our way to being victors.” She also stated that healthy communities dont just happen, they are made. Were showing Yale university how to make that community today. The purpose of this March was to empower, as a sophomore named Elisia Ceballo-Countryman said, “This week we cried, we screamed, we shouted, wailed, chalked, stood, shook, sat, danced, sung, and hugged …. Today is not about cryingIt is time for a change in strategy. It is time for student power.” The March of Resilience began at the Afro-American Cultural Center, and continued to each of the four cultural centers before ending at Cross Campus. Performing groups from each of the cultural centers present themselves to the crowd of 1,200. ¡Oye! Spoken Word represented La Casa, the Latinx Cultural Center. Sarah Pearl Heard, spoke about her experience as first generation Black and Mexican student. She described the burden that children of color and students at this institution face when interacting with students and administration who are unsympathetic to such experiences. Blue Feather, a Native American drumming group two performed two songs, one entitled “Young and Free” and the other was untitled, but a favorite at intertribal Powwows. Unity, the Korean Drumming Troupe performed a song that imitated a storm, one that is traditionally played in hope of a good harvest. Shades of Yale, a African Dispora Acapella group performed a medley of “We Shall Overcome/Amen. After Nodumo’s speech, a party ensued. The hit singles “Alright” and “King Kunta” by Kendrick Lamar were played, along with many other R;B and Hip-Hop songs.  Partying, break dancing and line dancing contributed to an overwhelming joyful atmosphere.  Many faculty, including Professor Jafari Allen, associate head of Ezra Stiles College Alicia Schmidt-Camacho, head of Ezra Stiles College Stephen Pitti, Dean of Ezra Stiles Camille Lizarribar, head of Berkeley College Marvin Chung and head of Pierson College Professor Stephen Davis were in attendance. There also many white allies present, and the sea of faces in the crowd of 1,200 was very diverse. The Yale School of Drama, and various departments of the graduate schools were in attendance in high numbers.  Students from all four cultural centers helped organize the march, and most of the organizers were women of color. One woman at the rally held a sign saying this is not a protest. The March of Resilience was not a protest, but a display of solidarity, commitment to positive change, and joy in the face of weariness. Everyone in attendance that day was reminded that “We are unstoppable, another Yale is possible.” &nbsp; Correction: A previous version of this article said that Blue Feather performed a song called Young and Pretty. This has been corrected to show that Blue Feather performed a song called Young and Free.  					Next Yale, youre doing it right ! Keep fighting!! We all will, thats our only option for survival  					Love these demands! 					These demands are GREAT. Do Not allow Yale to stall you however. The administration is good at that tactic. I know from our experiences from the 1970s. PUSH hard, Stay together, control the message! 					Awesome!  I cant believe it. Its 2015! Are they REALLY still using Master as a title? Dont they understand? I cant even.  Honestly, I think these are just the beginning. Its a great start, but this work will have to keep going for decades to truly, truly represent PoC voices. 					FINALLY! I was wondering whether any of the younger generation would ever stand and be heard on blatant racism in our universities, institutions and our economy. I thought like the rest that the younger generation would be fixated on just generating fortune, leaving the work needing to be done in an indefinite stasis. THANK YOU! THANK YOU!        by Treston Codrington At a time when students around the nation are confronting the negligence of their school administrators and calling for their resignation, Yale administrators like Timothy Dwight (TD) Head of College Mary Lui and Dean Sarah Mahurin have decided to take action. During last Saturday’s brunch, TD held an open forum for students to discuss the current racial and gender issues facing Yales campus. It was not an easy conversation to have, but there were two important conclusions from the meeting: The first was that many students felt they didn’t have the space to talk or think freely about racial tensions on campus and second was that students of color on the front lines are exhausted from bearing the burden to educate. Mary Lui is very aware of her role as the “intellectual, cultural, and social” leader of TD College. This is Lui’s first semester as the Head of TD and already she is wildly popular. “Mixmaster L,” as she is affectionately called by TD sophomore Rosa Vargas, has made a great effort to get to know the people of Timothy Dwight intimately. “She has made a great effort to get to know all of the Masters Aides and freshman especially,” said Vargas, one of the TD kitchen aides. “She also met with the kitchen aides and other aides in charge of TD spaces at the beginning of the year to learn about how the student spaces worked and work on ways of improving them. She really cares about the TD family. Its obvious shes very dedicated to the college.” When she isn’t sitting through her popular TD office hours, Lui can be found in the American Studies department. Professor Lui specializes in Asian-American history, Women and Gender Studies, as well as Urban history. With this background she and Dean Mahurin, who has a Yale Ph.D in English with a focus in Southern and African-American literature, felt prepared to make a move. “As educators, Dean Mauhrin and I felt like [we have got to] do our job. Let us help take the burden of educating our students. Let’s own it.” In an e-mail following up Saturday’s brunch, Lui reaffirmed her and Dean Mahurin’s commitment to making sure everyone at Yale feels at home. “As the Dean and Master of the college,” Lui wrote, “we are not here to question those experiences or emotions but to take them on as a sign that we have to do better as a college and university.” She recognized the “ethical obligation” that students of color feel “to carry on the work of…activists before us.” She also recognized that many students ask how they can better understand the pain and anger of students of color on campus. “We’ve seen the very distressed, the very confused, and the very supportive.” she told me. “Students want to be thoughtful and helpful but are not sure how they can be.” So she and Dean Mahurin created the reading group, which originated as a student idea. The reading group meets for 6 hour-long sessions held during lunch period in Timothy Dwight’s Thompson Room. The first session was Thursday, November 12th, and the sessions will continue through Friday, November 20th. “It is a big experiment and a nice start to creating more intellectual spaces.” Each session has a reading assigned to it that students do before hand in order to have a profound discussion. The idea seems to be well received by TD students. All six sessions are fully booked. “I think they have the potential to bring our community closer together as literature seems like one of the better and fuller means of communication we have,” said William Eckner (TD ’18). TD senior Asia Brown responded, “I think it is a good and necessary opportunity for students to take advantage of. Especially considering we don’t have mandatory classes to help people learn about themselves and others.” In fact, Lui also recommended in her e-mail that students also take classes on social inequality to “build a critical vocabulary needed to engage in those questions as both an intellectual enterprise and an ethical duty.” Another TD student told me, “It’s awesome that people want to educate themselves on this matter. It means I’ll be less likely to have to explain the same thing six times a day.” If we are to move forward at all in terms of racial equality. WE need to understand each others pain and grief. We cant move forward if half of us dont understand or even perceive a problem So now, Yale. As the saying goes, the ball is in your court. It is time we all bear the burden to educate ourselves. Below are the list of the books that TD students will be discussing over the next week: Richard Wright, “The Ethics of Living Jim Crow,” Martha Biondi, “The Black Revolution on Campus” poetry by Natasha Trethewey Zitkala-za “School Days of an Indian Girl” Asian American Students’ Report (1970s) and other readings Jeff Hobbs, The Short and Tragic Life        by Jessica Yuan, YC15  When I was in elementary school, I thought it was normal when other kids would pull their eyes into slits at me. I did it back because I thought it was a game, like a high five or secret friendship handshake. There was also the one where you pulled your eyelids up for Chinese, straight to the sides for Japanese, and down for Korean. Everyone did it at each other, the Asian kids too, and we all had a couple of laughs and a great time. I did this to my own eyes in the mirror yesterday to see if I remembered it correctly, and I burst out crying. I saw how easy it was for me to be caricatured, dehumanized, trapped in violently reductive representation. I wanted to show my friends, to expose this, and also I wanted to hide it forever so they would never see me this way. How many of us have experienced things like this? We played “cops and robbers and the robbers just happened to be Black children. We played “cowboys and Indians” not knowing the trauma of reenacting Indigenous genocide. I hope that most of us would have a hard time describing this as harmless play, as an exercise in creativity. This is not the blank slate of childhood imagination at work. These children are mirroring the racist ideology of the world they have been socialized into. One Thanksgiving, in third grade, we made paper hats, black paper buckle hats for the Pilgrims, and paper feather headdresses for the Native Americans. Everyone wanted to be a pilgrim so the teacher had to assign who got to wear a buckle hat and who wore a headdress. It’s been close to 15 years so I can’t say whether she made this division based on any conscious or unconscious racial bias but yeah, you’d cringe at the class photo. All I remember is really wanting to be a pilgrim, really wanting to be on the winning side of American history. I was eight years old, and I had a teacher who encouraged us to appropriate indigenous culture, who encountered children with such a deeply internalized white supremacy that they would rather dress as white settlers. It seemed so normal to me that all the children of color I knew, all my friends, wanted to be white. One of my Asian girl friends told me about trying to cut a double eyelid into her face with a butter knife. I remember being five and asking  my mom why my scars were lighter than the rest of my skin. I imagined peeling and scraping off my yellow, strip by strip until my body came out white. I hear stories of young girls asking their mothers to pour bleach in the bathtub, of not playing sports because they didn’t want to get tan. And to five year old me, this was not a violent thought, and it was not self-hatred. It was normal because whiteness is normal. So much incredible academic work has been done on the experiences of children of color  in particular I owe so much to Anne Anlin Chengs The Melancholy of Race. And we should all know about Kenneth and Mamie Clarks doll experiments, where Black children preferred to play with and identified more strongly with white dolls. And all of us growing up in the nineties watched TV with mostly white characters and white stories (with casually stereotyped people of color) and we grew up identifying with white heroes, imagining ourselves as white heroines. As long as systemic racism continues, the realm of childhood imagination will also be a white world. When we accept this, we permit future generations to denigrate people of color, to accept a white supremacist version of history, andto refuse to think critically about race. To end racism, we must give space to our children of color, space for them to celebrate who they are, to be represented fairly, to grow up feeling fully human. To end the story, it took me a long time to wake up, so long Im embarrassed sometimes. When I came to Yale, I didn’t know when my screw dates were fetishizing me as an Asian woman, and I took it as a compliment instead. I wasnt interested in social justice. I used skin lightening cream (Fair ; Lovely, ughhhhhh) until my sophomore year. I stayed neutral and passive, like so many Asian Americans and second generation Americans, because we were made to accept these things in order to assimilate. I want to apologize for the way I acted before I became conscious of these things, when I perpetuated white supremacy and heteronormativity because of internalized racism and sexism. And I need to thank the people who helped me grow up. I want to thank the brilliant women of color who pointed out things that I wouldve just taken silently, who got offended for me, who fought for me until I knew enough to fight for myself. Before any of us became Ivy League students of color, before any of us became courageous critical thinkers, we were yellow, Black, and  brown children confronting a world that we trusted to respect and love us. So we grew up trusting a world that was fundamentally racist and sexist in its roots. We were taught a history that erases us, that misrepresents us and trivializes our suffering. We accepted as normative a world that marginalized us, and we thought it was harmless because that is what children do. This is why it takes a lifetime to decolonize ourselves. 					Thank you. 					You say others have helped you along and pointed out things that were just taken silently  you did that for me. Thank you. I especially appreciated this as you put into words something Ive experienced for a very long time and just simply didnt have the guts not the words to out it into being: I want to apologize for the way I acted before I became conscious of these things, when I perpetuated white supremacy and heteronormativity because of internalized racism and sexism. Thank you so much. Great piece. Please, keep writing! 					This is a really beautiful and brave piece. The imagery is so powerful, that I am taken back to my own childhood. Its simply breathtaking. Thank you for sharing such a personal, yet common experience. In recent days, society has seen a surge of activism across the United States in support of social justice, particularly in response to enduring racist and sexist inequities on university campuses. At Yale University and beyond, many of these student-led movements are not only about addressing the latest instances of injustice but also about redressing the much deeper violences of racism, sexism, classism, and settler colonialism upon which the United States and its institutions of higher education are founded. We, the undersigned members of Yales Indigenous Graduate Network (IGN) ; Native American Law Students Association (NALSA), publicly affirm our solidarity and support for these social justice activism efforts. Our solidarity and support extends not merely to the cause itself but also to the wellness of the students leading these charges. At Yale, we stand with the undergraduate students—especially women of color—who themselves stand at the helm of these movements, investing their time, energy, and intelligence into an institution that has yet to make good on its promises of substantive inclusion. We demand the university hear these students’ voices and do more to support the structural transformations for which they advocate, including but not limited to: strengthened recruitment and retention policies for students, faculty, staff, and administrators of color across the university; improved mental health resources, especially the recruitment of mental health professionals of color; and increased investment in Ethnic Studies and Indigenous Studies through the creation of multiple full-time tenure track faculty positions. To the Yale undergraduate community: we are deeply appreciative of you and your leadership in the vitally important task of rebuilding Yale as a just and welcoming place for all students, particularly for women of color, including ourselves. Please do not hesitate to let us know how we can turn this expression of solidarity into concrete action in support of your work. With admiration and affirmation, Pablo N. Barrera, Yale Graduate School of Arts ; Sciences, Art History (Wirraritari)        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon “If truth, reason and conclusive argument, compounded with admirable temper and perfect candour, might be supposed to have an effect on the minds of man, we should think this work would have put an end to agitation on the subject [of slavery].”   “Memoir on Slavery” by William Harper (1853) One week ago, I wrote an article under the charming title “Fuck the Feelings.” In this article, I considered the evil of campus racism not as a function of POC emotional hurt, but as an objectively and invariably abhorrent moral travesty. I sought to thwart even the most adamant of white skeptics and detractors with dispassionate reason, and I succeeded. Life in a vacuum was beautiful! But now I disavow it. On Monday, my history professor sent out William Harper’s proslavery essay “Memoir on Slavery” as assigned reading. He urged my class “not to focus solely on registering moral abhorrence” in our reading responses because this would prevent us from engaging critically with the material. I approved of the advice. I approved because living among skeptical white people has taught me that my personal moral compass and axiomatic truth—my lived experience—have no intellectual value in civilized debate. *** The night before class, I comb systematically through 50 pages of brazenly racist BS, isolating rhetorical strengths and weaknesses with clinical precision. I craft meticulous refutations. Imagine my shock when I arrive to class the next day only to hear my white classmates dismiss Harper’s arguments in fits of moral outrage. It is with a growing sense of guilt and confusion that I, and I alone, speak up to present a slaveholder’s arguments in a painstakingly generous and “impartial” light. I do it instinctively so that my own refutations might appear above reproach. I am horrified when my white male professor shoots me an incredulous look and informs me, “Slavery and free labor are fundamentally different.” I cry. My logic has betrayed me. My attempt to engage with William Harper within the framework of his own dehumanizing logic—in order to avoid being written off as too emotional, or too militant, or intellectually incompetent—destroys both my emotional wellbeing and my integrity. But I do learn something. I learn that the price of fighting on the terms of the oppressors is to endorse their racism. My white classmates have the luxury of accepting or dismissing arguments on purely moral grounds. My peers assume, and assume correctly, that their axioms will be honored. People of color can either play by the rules of pseudo-egalitarian hyper-rationality, remain unheard, or be belittled and dismissed as unintellectual. We learn from a young age that no one gives a fuck about our “axioms.” It’s an unwinnable game. *** I pray that moving forward, I will refuse to play. My professor says that the only way to escape is disruption—historically speaking, a Civil War—and I pray that NextYale, and #ConcernedStudent1950, and all of the contemporary sister movements will be ours. I pray that I will be the first to acknowledge not only the validity, but the moral necessity of emotion and lived experience as baselines of intellectual discourse. I pray all of this despite my agnosticism, because to rely on rhetoric alone at this time is to pursue a hollow and degrading victory. It is a debate won, but a battle for white respect lost. It is the scorn of posterity. It is, simply put, too high a price to pay. 					Dear Alejandra. Butand here I speak as an old, white, male history professor, so take my words with a grain of saltI think you shortchange yourself if you dont embrace what you did, and how you pushed into the text to see what else it could reveal.  I dont teach that text, but I do teach Fitzhugh and other slavery apologists, Madison Grant, and any number of other morally odious writers in my intellectual history course.  (I also teach Douglass and Du Bois and Ida B. Wells, of course).   Its important not to whitewash US history, and one way to do that is to leave out all the ugly bits, or else only put in only the stupidest versions of the ugly arguments, so that everyone can feel morally superior and leave it at that.  Your professor was right, in my opinion, to push your class to grapple with an ugly text, and right also in pushing everyone in the class to not just dismiss it as ugly racism, but to think about what the author was arguing and what it can tell us.  However, it appears your professor failed miserably, and was simply wrong, when it came to the class experience itself.  YOU figured it out, because you did the hard work of digging into the text, that the easy separation of free labor and slave labor in antebellum America was not so clear cut as the proponents wanted their minions to believe.  The southern slavery apologists, as vile as they were, often saw much more clearly than anyone else just how severe the costs were of northern factory capitalism and how much northern workers were living lives of misery.   Your professors glib remark that “Slavery and free labor are fundamentally different, is incorrect, both intellectually and morally.  You figured this out, and thus opened the door to the possibility of some very challenging and important discussions about the nature of northern industrial conditions, the power of northern racism to make an alliance between northern wage slaves and southern chattel slaves almost inconceivable to most in the north, the romance of paternalism and how it could be used to make exploitation more palatable to masters south and north, and so on.  That your professor did not push the rest of the students in your class to expand their sense of moral outrage by engaging with the difficult substance of the text and its puncturing of easy moral distinctions between good north and bad south is, well, in my estimation, almost disgraceful.  That the professor did not have the moral courage to push out beyond an easy condemnation of bad southern racists is even more so.   I would urge you to revel in your intellectual accomplishment and your tough-minded ability not to suspend your moral outrage (or any other emotions from anger to pity to pride to love) but to use them to see more clearly and more deeply, and to force uncomfortable conversations, such as about the power of northern racism to create and maintain self-justifying binaries, such as the absolute difference between free labor and slave labor in the antebellum north.  You were right; please dont lose that because the professor and the rest of the class werent as smart or as brave as you were. 					Dear Prof. Carson, While I appreciate your thoughtful response, I believe you have missed the point of my article. Firstly, I showed that the expectation of sanitized rationality is applied on a racialized basis.  Secondly, I implied that sometimes, the moral cost of critiquing arguments on their own terms requires the moral debasement of the critic. It requires that she work within a tainted and problematic framework of potentially irrefutable assumptions and value judgments, and to implicitly accept them as true. Harpers particular arguments are far from irrefutable. However, they demonstrate the need for a moral baseline of discussion.  In the current wave of social movements and social tensions, people of color should not have to work WITHIN a system of racist value judgments to defend their own personhood and value; they have a right and an obligation to engage detractors on a moral level, even if said detractors will not recognize the validity of anyone elses subjectivity, because even worse than the racialized application of expectations of rationality is racialized access to integrity.  Before we are debaters, we are humans. We cannot love ourselves if we abandon the axioms of our lived experience for the axioms of a sexist and racist system that does not love us, even in debate. Furthermore, we cannot truly improve our condition if we let racist and sexist assumptions stand. At some point, a clash of morals is in order.  When the morals and lived experiences of people of color clash with the morals and lived experiences of white people, the former is described as unintellectual while the latter is rarely even recognized to be subjective. This cannot stand. Thus, although there is much to be gleaned from Harpers revolting work, I am far more interested in recognizing the level of privilege white intellectuals enjoy in crafting and critiquing rhetorical work with their own morals as the ultimate basis – and how diffuse their subjectivity really is – than deluding myself into believing that there exists purely logical discourse at any time, and that people of color must adapt to it. 					I also wish to point out that my brilliant and methodical professor did not say that free labor and slave labor were fundamentally different out of a moral abhorrence for slavery – although that certainly informed his line of thought. At the time, he was pointing out the fundamental differences between the two kinds of labor exploitation, many of which have a deep moral significance – such as agency and personhood under the law, or the security of knowing that ones spouse and children will not be sold away as human flesh. Do not be so quick to paint him as a well-meaning but none-too-rigorous liberal do-gooder. He is your peer. Far from not knowing and mastering the expectations of his field, he has learned them, recognized their flaws, and sought to transcend.        Dear President Salovey, We, as the Yale delegation for the Latinx Ivy League Conference, write to inform you of our concerns regarding our experiences at Brown University earlier today. We acknowledge that you are a partner in creating a cultural shift at Yale, and being an agent of change in improving the experiences of students of color. However, after what we witnessed and felt today at Brown, we are further reassured that this is a problem beyond Yale.  Last night, a Latino student delegate from Dartmouth College was the victim of assault at the hands of law enforcement hired by Brown’s Student Activities’ Office. The incident was deeply concerning not only to the victim, but also to the the Brown community, the Dartmouth community, and other university communities represented in the Latinx Ivy League Conference. Student delegates were compelled to abandon the schedule of events and act to mobilize their collective efforts to bring immediate attention to the incident at hand.  While students engaged in discussion about the incident, the Brown delegation quickly mobilized students of color and allies in the broader campus community to join in a forum to address this incident. The forum revealed that this was not an isolated event on Brown’s campus. Students of color at Brown University have been actively voicing their traumatic experiences with law enforcement on campus to the administration. These concerns, according to the students, have been received with a dismissive and invalidating response.  Coincidentally, Brown University’s president Christina Paxson had been invited to speak at the conference to welcome the Latinx Ivy League delegates in the early afternoon. Faculty and administrators present at the meeting contacted her and informed her of the situation. They encouraged her to enter the forum and focus her effort on listening to student grievances. Prior to President Paxson’s arrival, the head delegates of each Ivy League delegation had met to compose a letter outlining the situation and vocalizing demands. These demands included concrete suggestions from students aiming to establish preventative measures against future law enforcement aggressions towards students of color. Such demands included a public acknowledgment of the incident along with an apology on behalf Brown’s administration, a bias reporting system, and a partnership between student event organizers and campus security.  President Paxson’s response was initially promising, as she openly recognized that this incident indicated what she described as “the second wave of the Civil Rights movement”. She also acknowledged the importance of student of color leadership, and condemned any form of “brutality” on Brown’s campus. However, as the conversation proceeded, President Paxson failed to fully engage with the students in not validating their lived experiences. The incident was extremely reminiscent of the recent exchanges between students and administrators at Yale, most notably the encounters between Dean Jonathan Holloway and students of color at Cross Campus and Silliman Master Nicholas Christakis and students of color at the Silliman College courtyard. Students of color at both Yale and Brown are visibly hurt, frustrated, and disillusioned with the manner in which their administration has failed to foster an inclusive and welcoming university climate for all. Our hope is that, in bringing this incident to your attention, you will reckon with the reality that recent events at Yale are part of a larger institutional issue affecting students of color across the Ivy League. We, the Latinx Ivy League Conference delegation, trust that you and the broader Yale administration will act to ensure that Yale is at the forefront of implementing solutions to these systemic issues of racial and ethnic inequality in institutions of higher learning.  Con fuerza y con fe, The Yale Delegation, 2015 Latinx Ivy League Conference Karen Lazcano, SM ‘16        View the signatures here  Dear Members of the Yale Community, In light of recent events the last week, we have seen Yale undergraduates come together to express their anger, frustration, and sadness over the unsafe environment that Yale has created for students of color. These protests are not only about the events of the last week, but also about students of color demanding real change from Yale University regarding racial and gender justice. As members of the Yale community we have borne witness to the racial and gender inequality that is persistent at Yale, and the administration’s inaction to make concrete changes to fix these problems. As graduate students at Yale, we stand for racial and gender equality on campus, and continue to call on the administration to promote tenure-track faculty of color hiring, to retain these faculty of color, and create a diverse student body in the graduate school. For these reasons, we, the undersigned members of the graduate school, stand in solidarity with the undergraduate students of color on campus in their continued fight for racial and gender justice on campus. We stand by them as they make their demands to the administration, and support their acts of protest. Written by Randa Tawil and LiLi Johnson        Alumni can sign here Dear Black Students of Yale, As members of Yale University’s Black alumni community, we write to express our support and solidarity with you and other students of color at Yale as you raise your voices in protest, and mount a call to action by the Yale administration in order to address the racism that continues to plague the University. Whether we graduated in 1971 or 2011, we are aware that racism at Yale is etched in the stained glass windows and the names of the residential colleges, and was laid with Elihu Yales East India Corporation profits as the first stones were set on Cross Campus. You are often subjected to assumptions regarding your intellectual abilities by peers and professors, vulnerable to sexual harassment and assault and other forms of misogynoir, and racially profiled by campus police officers asking for ID. Every. Single. Time. Racism leaves your voice unacknowledged or silenced when you call out for support. It is both personal and individual as well as structural and institutional. We know that safe space  though intangible and easily taken for granted  is no small thing. It is everything. Because you are standing up and speaking your truth, your hard work is paying off. It has captured the attention of the Yale administration and larger community, and the wheels of change have been set in motion. We are here, and we see you and we hear you. We are listening, and we will come to you to help you in any way that we can to elevate and amplify your voices and ensure that change happens and that it is maintained. Finally, we want you to know that we are incredibly proud of all of you and how you are continuing to represent Black Yale in the fight for complete and equitable access to the education you are promised. In Solidarity, Rana Emerson (CC 93) 					I signed on ; thanks for doing; but would appreciate seeing another petition with stronger, more specific arguments. p.s.:  I have just completed ; posted on my FB page  rather detailed response to the Halloween memos, including a reiteration of ; expansion on the few specific demands Ive heard articulated.

Prince herself is Black Cherokee, though not a Freedman. Her comment offered a suggestive preview of the fraught intersection between Black and Native identities in a country pockmarked by slavery and genocide. At the Afro-Native American Heritage Panel held at the Af-Am House on Wednesday, November 11, discussion ranged from the need for Black-Native solidarity, to academia’s neglect of Black-Native identities, to exposition on the historical tensions between Black and Native communities. Dean Kelly Fayard of the Native American Cultural Center began by recounting the devastation wrought by settler colonialism and Euro-American civilizing projects on the Native community. She noted that some Native populations, including the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast, adopted plantation slavery as part of an overall push for assimilation. The forum also incorporated personal statements from two self-identified Black Native Yale women, Karléh Wilson ’16 (Black Creek) and Naivasha Harris (Choctaw and Cherokee). Both stressed that Blackness and Nativeness are integral, complementary, and inseparable parts of their identity. “I feel like if I had to choose one race and stick with it, I would be betraying my family members,” said Wilson. However, reconciling the two is not without its challenges. Harris expressed frustration that many in the Native community doubt the validity of her Native identity, accusing her of being “just one of those people who claims to have a Cherokee grandma”—when she does indeed have a Cherokee grandmother—while she feels pressure from the Black community to “identify as only Black, or I’m not Black enough.” For many, the forum was a unique opportunity to explore the intersections between Black and Native identity. Trumbull junior Tobias Holden remarked that he was excited by “the fact that this event existed.” “I didn’t even know what I had going on today, and I was like, ‘I’m going!’” he said, laughing. The element of self-discovery also held true for Eliza Quander ’16, who at one point was asked point-blank whether she was Black Native. “I never said that before, and I’m not sure I have a right to say it, but I guess I’m learning that,” she said. Quander is of Cherokee descent. “I think I was letting the way people see me affect my own identity more than it should,” she later reflected. Dean Fayard was quick to welcome both Holden and Quander to spend time at the Native American Cultural Center, stressing that it is an inclusive and diverse community. Unfortunately, collaborations between the House and the NACC such as Wednesday’s forum have been sporadic and rare, and in the broader realm of academia, the Black Native identity has been largely ignored. “We feel very invisible,” said Harris, alluding to the fact that there are few Native students on campus, and even fewer Black Natives. “There’s not much scholarship on who I am,” noted Wilson. “There are no words.” Both women expressed regret that it had taken until their senior year for them to get to know each other. Holden felt it was a shame that it “took this long for me to feel like these [Black and Native] identities could complement each other.” Ultimately, however, all parties expressed optimism about the future of Black Native dialogue on campus and on the national level. “One of the things this week has shown is that we can’t fix anything unless we band together,” said Harris, referencing the recent flurry of student activism as universities nationwide reach a tipping point on tensions surrounding institutionalized racism. Ultimately, the solution may lie in discarding misleading and divisive conceptions of racial and ethnic identity. “Those ideas about race are just colonial imports that we can reject as an expression of sovereignty,” declared Prince.        by Daad Sharfi This past week, the Yale African Student Association (YASA) held its annual Africa Week around the theme “Think. Contemporary Africa.” This event featured a week-long series of discussions, debates and workshops with both guest speakers and resident student groups to celebrate the vibrancy and ingenuity ofwait for itthe continent. Not a territory, not a country but an entire continent composed of 54 (55 depending on whom you ask) unique nations.  On the last day of Africa Week 2015, YASA invited Boniface Mwangi-an award-winning Kenyan photojournalist and activist to speak on social justice and political activism. Mwangi began the conversation candidly as he expressed the adversity he endured while growing up in poverty, being expelled from five different schools for persistently asking the difficult questions, and eventually dropping out of high school to pursue his passion for photography and visual art.  It was after documenting the 2007 post-election violence in Kenya that Mwangi decided to put his flourishing career as an internationally-renowned photographer on hold. Unable to simply move on and mentally erase the violence and injustice that erupted in his country after incumbent Mwai Kibaki was declared President, he quit his job as a photographer for The Standard. He decided to dedicate himself to social justice, envisioning a Kenya with peaceful elections and political leaders who can govern the country with an impartiality to ethnic and tribal lines.  While presenting his work as an activist to a room full of undergraduates, graduate students and faculty members, Mwangi clearly recognized the power of the image and the significance of the untold story in the face of injustice: “In remembering, we don’t forget. We reconstruct. We reveal.” Following through with his own words, Mwangi published Kenya Burning a visual narrative on the post-election violence he observed soon after quitting his job. Mwangi’s commitment to the use the visual arts as a medium by which the oppressed are empowered and the oppressors are held accountable culminates in his founding of PAWA 254 in 2009. The acronym “PAWA” is a Swahili corruption of “power” while 254 is the international telephone code of Kenya. As the first of its kindthis non-profit initiative provides Nairobi’s most creative photographers, journalists, musicians, poets, filmmakers and graphic designers with an innovative and collaborative workspace to effect social change. For Mwangia self-proclaimed “active citizen” who makes a conscious effort to bring his two young children to protests along with himactivism is not a part-time job or hobby, but a living part of his person. After presenting two short filmsboth of which reveal how frequently Mwangi experienced aggression at the hands of police officers when leading peaceful protests such as Occupy Parliament-he quickly transformed the event into an open discussion with audience members.  Cognizant of the current campus climate surrounding racial justice, Mwange commended students for speaking out against the discrimination they face on campus and the list of demands they compiled. He encouraged them to exploit their uniqueness and use their personal narratives to tell the stories that have historically been told on their behalf. A timely and indispensable reminder, his words deeply resonated with those in the room: “If your truth does not make some people uncomfortable, then you are not speaking the truth.” &nbsp;        by Sarah Pearl Heard “Here, take a crane or a flower!” I am handed a shoebox full of petite, colorful origami creations and a program for the Nov. 13th performance by Jook Songs, Yale’s Asian spoken word group. I choose a paper rose and squeeze through a packed theater to sit in the front row. The seats are mostly filled with students of color, eagerly anticipating the show. What followed did not disappoint. Each poet performed a piece roughly seven to ten minutes long. Each performer pulled me into a different story unique to their own experience. The worries they expressed were some that the majority of the audience could relate to: failed love, family disappointment, adolescent self loathing, and feeling out of place.  Teresa spoke about being the one to read her parents bedtimes stories in order to help them with their English, describing the difficulty of trying to live with “a foot in each world.” Other performers elaborated on these pangs of growing up in two cultures that are at odds with each other in a simultaneously hilarious, yet poignant fashion.  In a different light, Stephanie summed up her teenage angst, grappling with stereotypes during a time when “social inconsistency is cute.” Cathy extrapolated this mood, reconveying snippets of heated interactions with her (ex) white boyfriend and the dichotomy of a love that is battling power dynamics and privilege with each gesture of romance.  The show also grappled with darker themes. Another performer, KZ, spoke about the burden of carrying the struggles of her grandparents who migrated here with the haunting line “The memories that kept them alive are dying.” Karina similarly spoke about the burden of carrying the weight of her father’s dream throughout every aspect of her life. Jook Songs serves as a safe haven for the expression of oppressed peoples. As stated in their program “Jook Songs has been a place of refuge for us. We offer support to the people fighting now. We also honor those who continue to create safe spaces and spaces of healing on campus.” Grace Lee Boggs said, A revolution that is based on people exercising their creativity in the midst of devastation is one of the greatest historical contributions of mankind.” Thank you Jook Songs for contributing to that mission and providing such beauty in the wake of devastation and for the lovely origami rose, of course. &nbsp;        DOWN Zine: Love and Power at Yale (pdf)                           <a hre        by Ashia Ajani  When I tell people that I’m from Denver, Colorado, I usually receive a snicker and get asked if I either smoke weed, ski or both. Colorado is often portrayed as a state filled with yuppie liberals and pretty scenery. This is true, for the most part. But what most people are unaware of are the chapters of white conservatism and extremism that are housed within our borders. Colorado Springs has had an active KKK base since the Prohibition Era.  And last year, the city was ranked as the fourth most conservative major city in the country. There is a running “joke” among people of color in Denver that if you love yourself, you avoid Colorado Springs at all costs. Colorado Springs is a cesspool of white extremism that often goes unrecognized by the media. That is why when I first received word that there was a hostage situation at a Planned Parenthood in the city, I was not surprised. I also wasn’t surprised that the white man who killed three people and wounded nine others was taken into custody alive. This isn’t the first time Colorado law enforcement has “peacefully” arrested a white man for shooting up a building. In Aurora, Colorado James Holmes was taken alive after opening fire in a movie theater. And of course, this isn’t the first time white privilege has come to the rescue of mass shooters all over the country. These violent men, because of the pigment of their skin, are described as misunderstood lone wolves, as opposed to the terrorists they are. This is the same system that views Black and Brown bodies as monolith and inherently dangerous, and white ones as brooding and misunderstood.. When white supremacists shoot up a Black Lives Matter protest, they aren’t perceived as threats. When white supremacists make threats against students of color on college campuses, professors still demand that these students of color come to class. However, when protestors gather on Colfax in response to the Michael Brown verdict, they are tear-gassed. Marginalized people, however, will keep on fighting. Protests and vigils in honor of Jamar Clark will keep on going. We will not forget Sandra Bland, Lamia Beard and the countless other Black and Brown people that have been murdered. Planned Parenthood put out a statement: “These doors stay open.” We will keep deploring racialized and gendered violence and fighting against it. Amidst the tear gas, our middle fingers stay up.        by Nicole Chavez  On November 9, Hillary Clinton spoke on immigration during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. When asked how she, as President, would attempt to better secure the Mexican-American border, Hillary referenced the votes she had made as a senator to establish a physical barrier between the two countries. In her statement she regarded the individuals who cross over the border as “illegal” immigrants. This is only one instance in a series of public statements Hillary has made throughout her political career in which she refers to immigrants, whether they be undocumented or refugees, as “illegal.” To many, the use of the word illegal to describe immigrants may not seem overtly outrageous. Given the frequency with which the word has been used, both by politicians and in the mainstream media, some may expect the general populous to have become desensitized to this treacherous misuse of language. Between 1980 and 2013, among all U.S. News sources, the word illegal within immigration-related articles was used an exorbitant 55 percent of the time. Whether it comes out of the mouth of an explicitly racist figure like Donald Trump or a relatively more progressive politician such as Hillary Clinton, many individuals freely describe undocumented immigrants as “illegal” without reflecting on the consequences their words have on the way society treats them. Certain individuals might criticize this trepidation as just another instance in which the Millennial culture of “Political Correctness” is encroaching on the way American politics and society run. These critics may claim that the language we use to discuss matters of immigration matter little so long as the policies crafted by the government ultimately treat immigrants humanely. What these individuals and politicians fail to see is how vocabulary fundamentally shapes policy, both in its objectives and the way in which it depicts the population they directly affect. Using the phrase “illegal immigrant” as an alternate to “undocumented immigrant” is a furtively transgressive act. The modifier illegal extends beyond describing an individual’s actions as criminal and interdicts her body. The arduous experiences of numerous immigrants are trivialized within the quip use of a single word. “Illegal immigrants” are no longer spouses, parents, or friends – they are now criminals who can justifiably be marginalized and oppressed by the U.S. government. How can one trust that government policies will humanize the conditions afflicting undocumented immigrants if the language policy makers and legislators use to describe these communities inevitably contribute to their erasure? This derogatory term also has a racialized connotation that exemplifies the dichotomized lends through which the American government and public view immigration. Seldom is the word illegal used to describe undocumented immigrants coming from Europe or Canada. They are often assumed to be either college students studying internationally or esteemed professionals. The negative connotation associated with immigrants is a burden imposed on Brown and Black bodies. Stereotypes of immigrants are associated with Mexicans who steal jobs and refugees from Third World countries who usurp the government’s resources. Contrary to these typecasts, it is society that exploits these immigrants, using their illegal status as a justification to do so. Ironically, industries rely on the cheap and expendable labor of these “illegal” bodies without acknowledging their own criminality in abusing them. Furthermore, in the deconstruction of the word illegal in its use in immigration politics, it becomes evident that the derogatory term is legally inaccurate. If anything, the word actually convolutes political discourse. The term is a sign that the laws in our nation are unjustly applied since “illegal” immigrants are found guilty for being in the U.S. before they can be tried. The term “illegal” circumvents the implications of systemic oppression on the documentation status of immigrants. It ignores the way in which the U.S.’s path to citizenship is designed to make it nearly impossible for undocumented individuals. This especially holds true for low-income, un(formally) educated immigrants who do not have thousands of dollar and/or the time to tediously apply for numerous forms of government sanction. Even when some degree of sanction is granted by the government, it is for a diminutive period of time. Students and workers who overstay their Visas and cannot receive an extension become undocumented immigrants. Refugees who overstay their period of asylum become undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants cooperating with the legal system to get citizenship are put on backlog for years, vulnerable to deportation meanwhile. These undocumented immigrants do not desire to break the law. The U.S. government, however, gives them no other viable option. On November 24, Telemundo, a American Spanish-language television network, hosted a Facebook chat that served as a venue for people, particularly Latinxs, to discuss immigration issues. At one point, Jose Antonio Vargas, a renowned immigration reform activist and journalist from the Philippines, called out Hillary Clinton for her use of the phrase “illegal immigrant” at her recent New Hampshire campaign stop. Vargas petitioned for Clinton to recognize the humanity of the 11.7 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. by not using the word illegal when referring to undocumented immigrants. Clinton responded to Vargas with the following statement: “That was a poor choice of words. As I’ve said throughout this campaign, the people at the heart of this issue are children, parents, families DREAMers. They have names, and hopes and dreams that deserve to be respected. I’ve talked about undocumented immigrants hundreds of times and fought for years for comprehensive immigration reform. And I will continue to do so. We are a country built by immigrants and our diversity makes us stronger as a nation – it’s something to be proud of celebrate and defend.” The commitment to alter her vocabulary and to better acknowledge the humanity of undocumented immigrants is a start, albeit a small one. Engraved on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty is Emma Lazarus’ sonnet “The New Colossus,” part of which reads “Give me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/ … Send these, the homeless, the tempest-tost to me.” If this sonnet speaks to the values that America stands by, then we must push to abolish the culture that stigmatizes undocumented immigrants. We must welcome them with open arms as does the Statue of Liberty in Lazarus’ poem. Our national vocabulary around immigration should not admonish these immigrants as illegal and criminal. As we strive to establish a more compassionate discourse on immigration, we must ensure that our government policies mirror our language as well.        by Ellie Pritchett  On November 5, about fifty Yalies of color met with President Peter Salovey. This is an article about what happened in that room. But really, this is an article about pain; this is an article about trauma; this is an article about death. *** “You get the sense you shouldn’t be there,” Jamie Hobson, a junior in Davenport, says of the austere room in Woodbridge Hall where the meeting was held, a room lined with full-length portraits of white men in powdered wigs staring down at you as you sit at the conference table. Again and again, as had been happening all that Thursday, students broke down under the weight of the emotions they were trying to convey. As Jamie Hobson, a junior in Davenport, sees it, people of color “relate their lives through empathy,” and so they tried, and have been trying, to reach people by getting them to feel what they feel, by telling their stories. According to Jordan Coley, a junior in Saybrook, the first speaker told Salovey he “should be ashamed” that he didn’t even think to respond to two blatant examples of racism on campus. As Jordan and Jamie both recount, students talked about how emotional the confrontation with Christakis, just hours before, had been. One student told Salovey about how, just as Erika Christakis’s email had said to do, she had approached a man wearing a headdress on Halloween to tell him how offensive it was, especially to her as a Native American. But the response she got wasn’t one of understanding; she was harassed and threatened and told that she meant nothing. But apart from these examples, Jamie reaffirms, students hardly mentioned the Christakises or SAE at all, trying to show again and again that experiencing racism on campus is a weekly and daily struggle for people of color at Yale. Students also strove to explain the difference between integration and inclusivity—this school may be integrated, but it isn’t inclusive. Being inclusive would involve all people of color feeling welcomed and at home here. The administration can acknowledge something, Jamie says, an event or a common occurrence, without admitting to its own culpability. “I don’t think it’s hard to send an email!” she says. The distinction between acknowledgement and admission is one of the things that separates how an integrated versus an inclusive campus would respond to what happened on campus. Lex Barlowe, the president of the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY), handed out copies of the list of demands that BSAY had written in its meeting two days before, and insisted that Salovey read them, right then and right there, insisting that he be held accountable for his actions and that he listen to her on her own terms. Hobson says holding Salovey accountable for his actions and his promises was a common theme throughout the meeting; about 2 hours in, she remembers insisting, “I need you to recap this, what are you getting out of this?” She says she knows he was listening with open ears, but she also says that when she left, she was completely unsure how much Salovey had actually been moved by their appeals and requests. Everyone was breaking down. It was like the walls were coming down. Jamie says the tipping point for her, when she really started crying, was when one girl said that she hated that she was crying in front of Salovey because her mother always told her that it meant she was weak. Everything that’s been happening on this campus, every confrontation, has been an exposure to trauma. It isn’t about the President being open to listening to demands from students of color—it’s about how absolutely insane it is that to be heard we have to cry. As Jamie puts it, to be humanized, we have to cry. For people to understand and to believe that we are in pain, we have to cry. Why isn’t it enough for a woman of color to tell you that she is in pain and she needs you to start doing something about it to believe her? In the aftermath of this meeting, in the aftermath of this day, there was madness. There were girls sprawled out on the floor of the Afro-American Cultural Center, weeping. There were women locking themselves in basement rooms to scream. Jamie recalls two freshman girls from her Cultural Connections group who walked into the House, saw Jamie, and collapsed, sobbing, having just had a man on the street shout “What up, niggers?” at them while they were walking. “No one wanted to leave the House,” Jordan remembers. “It felt like the end of days.” Even inside Woodbridge Hall, when student after student was breaking down in tears telling their stories, the prevailing sentiment aimed at Salovey was “You do not deserve these tears.” The tears come on their own, but you do not deserve this reaction from me. You do not deserve to see me vulnerable. You deserve nothing from me until you show me you respect me. When Lex noted her own anguish at the history of Black student leaders dying early, and that its her fate as president of BSAY, Salovey didn’t deny it. He confirmed her early death. He knew it had been happening and but never thought to do anything about it. And he didn’t suggest to do anything about Lex’s early death either. “That is wild,” Jamie says; we can’t take that. It all started innocently enough—a chalking event organized by BSAY to draw positive and affirming messages to women of color on the steps of Sterling. When Dean Holloway appeared, the event became a plea, and for two and a half hours, students of color asked with Holloway to give them an acknowledgment, write them an email, do something about the pervasive misogynoir on this campus. And then the chalking event moved to Silliman’s courtyard to do the same thing: chalk affirmative messages on the pavement. The chalking in Silliman became a confrontation and another plea when Christakis started going up to students and talking to them condescendingly, prompting students to attempt once again to get through to him about why his attitude and actions were disrespectful and hurtful. All they wanted was an apology, but he gave none, and all they got was tears—tears, and the pervasive sense that you mean nothing to this place, and no matter how many tears you shed, no matter how eloquently you describe how you feel, Yale administrators are going to maintain the power they have over you to oppress you and invalidate the pain you know you feel. And to top off this long day of crying, in the austere, wood-paneled conference room, full-length portraits of white eighteenth-century men in powdered wigs stared down at a table ringed with chairs inscribed with the names of the powerful and elusive Yale Corporation. It was in these chairs that the students of color, voicing the lack of inclusivity in the university had to sit, facing the administrators at the head of the table, in a room that even Salovey had to admit was an odd one for the meeting at hand. As he said in his opening remarks, according to Jamie, none of the men in the portraits would have wanted anyone in the room at Yale, including himself, being Jewish. Outside Woodbridge Hall, the exhausted group of student activists became music, “an acknowledgment of how unique this experience was,” as Jamie puts it. “It was something you have to write down so you can put it in your biography later,” she said more than once of the meeting and the aftermath, which Jordan calls “cinematic.” Native Americans students sang and prayed, and the group danced to Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright.” But when will we finally be alright?        by Karléh Wilson  When Hurricane Katrina ravaged my town in Louisiana, I remember being hungry and sad and intensely self-aware. I remember going to the store and seeing empty shelves where food should have been. I remember going to a gas station at 9pm and standing in line as I waited to receive just one piece of chicken  which would be the first thing that I had eaten that day. I remember not knowing whether my best friend was dead or alive for four days, and then being relieved when she and her dad walked into my driveway with just one loaf of bread to give us. I remember looking at that loaf of bread and knowing that it would have to feed my family of 5 for at least another few days. Weeks later, I saw news coverage depicting Black people as criminals, “looting” stores for televisions and food. But I know I wasn’t the problem. The problem was the US population’s ravenous hunger for more images upon which to base their unfounded moral claims against Black people. Over a decade later, here at Yale, I have to convince white adult men that I battle racism on this campus—these were administrators charged with my safety and success. Some were humbly receptive to my pain and asked for ways that they could help to make this campus a safer, more inclusive environment. Others challenged my feelings and asked me to prove that racism was the cause of my pain. When explaining the racism that I have endured on my track team to my head coach, he listened thoughtfully with reassuring nods and utterances of understanding. I described innumerable instances of being excluded by my teammates, and how they catalyzed specific acts of self-care that went misunderstood. My coach was still skeptical. He asked me if I had ever wondered if perhaps, just maybe, the problem was me. I said, yes of course! When a young and impressionable woman of color faces racism in covert forms, she looks inward. She starts to question her own values and wonder if maybe there is something inherently wrong with her. I am the problem in that my demand for dignity challenges an entire system’s understanding of humanity—one based on whiteness. I did not want to explain the hours that I spent every day examining what was wrong with me, or what was different about me. Why didn’t I deserve friendship in its most basic form? Was I asking too much from my peers? Was there a general understanding of me as a person that everybody shared that I was not clued into? These are the personal, private doubts that haunt young women of color on this campus. I gave my coach a fairytale-ending: I woke up one day and realized that there is nothing wrong with me. I expected my coach to be so happy for me. I thought that he understood that this breakthrough was a form of Black liberation—that he would be proud of me and say, “Wow, you are stronger than I thought.” Instead, he asked me if I was having a similar experience to a celebrity who can’t quite figure out if their friends are there just because they are famous or because they are actually a likable person. I became upset. I realized that maybe I had said too much to this person, and began to regret being open and vulnerable with him. He eventually said that I seem to have acceptance issues. He encouraged me to seek emotional therapy to talk these issues out with a professional. I realized that my coach could not see me as I am because he was blinded by his implicit bias that I am just a person with a problem. When it comes to racism, people of color are told that we are the ones with a problem. We’re an issue that politicians must deal with; we’re a controversy. “Racial issues” and “racial tensions” are viewed as moments we incite in reaction to something relatively small. “But race is the child of racism, not the father,” writes Ta-Nehisi Coates. Racism is the problem of white people. It is a reality they, not I, must work through and fix. So yes, I have wondered constantly whether or not I am the problem. And that soul searching led me to realize that I am not to blame for the ignorance and lack of humility by people who are racist. The politician proposes policy changes and diversity initiatives, not knowing that what he first must do is change his mind. People of color have a lot of problems to deal with—from misogyny to trauma to poor self-image. But racism is my former coach’s problem, it is CNN’s problem, it is Yale’s problem. It is not mine.        by Taylor Jackson  Every year, the South Asian Society puts on Roshni, a celebration of Southeast Asian culture and performing arts. Many members of South Asian student groups participated in the performances and recruited other students to join in. Over the course of the night of Friday, November 13th,  five of Yale’s South Asian dance groups performed, as well as our only South Asian a cappella group, Sur et Veritaal, a group that performs mashups of popular Western Music and Bollywood hits. At this year’s Roshni, they turned Lana Del Rey’s “Young and Beautiful, Sam Smith’s “Only One,” and Tu Jaane Na from the film Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani into one fluid piece that had the audience clapping along. The five South Asian dance groups performed a variety of routines. Some of the campus groups performed fusion dance styles. Yale Jashan Bhangra combines modern pop and hip hop styles with the traditional folk dance know as Bhangra from the Punjab Region of India. The dancers in Rangeela fuse classic Bollywood dance with different modern forms, and MonstRAASity combines the traditional Gurajati forms of Raas and Garba with pop and hip hop. Meanwhile, other campus groups took more traditional routes. A trio of dancers from Yale Kala, a group that perform classical Indian dances, performed a Kthak Bharatanatyam fusion dance. Kshitiz Kz from SAGA performed a solo piece, “a Tamil composition describing the effect of Krishna’s flute in Vrindavan.” In addition to the performances from official Yale extracurricular groups, each class year performed a dance choreographed by South Asian students but performed by students across that class year to mixes of Bollywood and modern pop songs. While South Asian students and traditions were the focus of the night, South Asian cultures and the many things associated with them were a common point of discussion with the Emcees for the night who devoted their time to discussions of love, Bollywood, and common misconceptions about South Asian people. They covered everything from naan, mothers, to Priyanka Chopra, teaching the audience about themselves and the cultures from which they hailed.        by Treston Codrington A bright smile, an open door, and a hot oven on Lilac Street breathe life back into Newhallville, New Haven. Minister Cynthia Johnson is cultivating “the next Julia Child” when she opens her home for baking sessions with neighborhood kids. The goal over these five years has been to restore the “creative diversity” she believes is endemic to Newhallville, but currently under-expressed. Born and raised in Newhallville, Ms. Cynthia has lived in the same house on Lilac Street for 28 years. “I grew up on the other end of Lilac. Then I moved to Winchester Avenue…then to Sherman then back here to Lilac Street.” Lilac Street is a two block street in the neighborhood that Ms. Cynthia says, “is too small to be divided.” The thoughtful Ms. Cynthia has borne witness to the transformations Newhallville has undergone over the past few decades. She grew up during an era of transformation. The late 1960s and 1970s were for Newhallville, like the rest of the country, bleak times. The great economic downturns and urban decay that noisily rocked cities like New York also quietly ravaged smaller places like New Haven, and its various enclaves. Newhallville had grown and developed as a thriving middle/working class, majority African-American neighborhood under the employ of the Winchester Repeating Arms factory since 1870. The company built houses for its workers: primarily one, two, or three family tenement-style houses. Eventually, these families earned enough to own the houses outright. At one time, Newhallville had the highest rate of African-American home ownership in Connecticut, and remains one of the highest. Ms. Cynthia fondly remembers the times when the people of Newhallville supported themselves and each other. “There was a lot of diversity of skill. I never had to leave a four block radius. Everything I needed was right here.” The laundry, the school, the grocery, the tailor: They were all owned or operated by people who lived in the neighborhood. “If Mom didn’t have, she would send me down the street to [a neighbor] for a cup of sugar. It was that kind of place,” she says with that characteristic bright smile, followed by the endearing chuckle. “If Ms. Mary found me misbehaving on the street, she could whoop me. She’d tell my Mom who would then whoop me because Ms. Mary had to whoop me.” She laughs. But in 1965, the Winchester Company departed when the owners realized that New Haven could no longer be profitable. The prosperity left too, then eventually people. People whose families had lived in or owned a property for several generations began to leave to find their fortunes elsewhere. The armament plant changed hands a few times, but the best times were behind. In 2006, the then U.S Repeating Arms Plant was closed, laying off 186 workers and ending over 130 years of arms production in Newhallville. In the years before Ms. Cynthia moved back to Lilac Street in 1987, repeated strikes and the near bankrupt state of the armament plant drained the economic life of other local businesses. “Most of those businesses are gone. The economic diversity isn’t here anymore. [Since] people can’t afford to pay for the diversity. Lots of people have credit issues. People talk all the time and say, “This lot would be good for this thing. I think that would do well over there. But hardly anyone can do anything to get it started,” she says. One can feel the weariness in her voice, but also the glimmer of hope. “People really can’t afford the insurance premiums.” High-crime rates have plagued Newhallville in recent decades. “It’s definitely been a roller coaster ride.” The loss of the factories brought not only poverty, high dropout rates and higher incarceration rates. But as Lieutenant Sharp of the New Haven Police Department says, “Things have quieted down, but the perception remains.” That perception has scared away a lot of potential investment from the neighborhood, but not all. The residents of Newhallville have been taking it upon themselves to restore their home and make it a wonderful place to live. Ms. Cynthia believes that Kids’ Kitchen, her baking class, is becoming a vehicle of restoration that she would have never imagined it to be. “It just started out with my kids. It was something for them to do and enjoy at Christmas time. Then as kids turned into grandkids, it continues and we started doing it throughout the year. Then one thing lead to another.” Kids on the block joined in. Then kids from the church. Now she has children of all ages coming into her home to bake on certain afternoons after school, especially around the holidays. “It gives kids the opportunity to create, make a mess, and laugh. It teaches them how to communicate and realize a sense of community”. Ms. Cynthia has always believed that a sense of community is the key to reviving the life of Newhallville. After all, “people make the neighborhood,” not just the buildings. She hopes to turn this into a full-fledged after-school program focused on working with remedial students. “I want to help them overcome math phobias,” she chuckled as she explained her rather brilliant idea. “If I have a recipe for twelve and we only have six people, what do we need to do to this recipe [to make it work]? So instead of two cups of flour, how much will we use? Ya know? The focus is to make this recipe to get cupcakes, but they don’t realize that they are operating on a math concept.” She has a very specific vision for Mother’s Day. “I am keeping an eye open for churches with a commercial-type kitchen or dining hall where I can get kids to come in and cook for their Mothers. You know, dress the tables and make it special. The kids can even put on a little production and read poems. (Ms. Cynthia is a talented and published poet herself). Again, just trying to get a community feel.” Ms. Cynthia plans on starting a Gofund me page soon so she can raise money to buy more hardware. Occasionally, parents bring ingredients, but as Kids’ Kitchen grows, she wants to have more capital in it. Investment. It is citizens of Newhallville like Ms. Cynthia who are investing their time, money, and effort into their own neighborhood to revive it. Citizens who comprise Newhallville Community Matters work to build pride in Newhallville by cleaning up and beautifying blocks like Lilac Street every spring. This group was launched in the wake of Yale University withdrawing from the housing projects it was involved with after the overseeing professor was robbed. The group is provided with gloves, bags, shovels, and extra volunteers by Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS), a non-for-profit Ms. Cynthia is very fond of. “I have to say, first of all, I love what they are doing,” she says of NHS. NHS’ ultimate goal, like Ms. Cynthias is to create a sense of unified community. NHS seeks to do that by giving people greater pride in where they live by renovating houses. They buy gut houses that the city would otherwise tear down and repair them to very high standards. Investors see the work that NHS puts in and help them along the process of buying and selling the houses. The group has renovated about 15-20 houses over a ten year period that are sprinkled all over Newhallville, including several on Lilac Street. “At first, neighbors, including myself, were suspicious of NHS because we weren’t sure who was coming into the area and fixing up these houses or what their agenda was exactly. That is usually done by absentee landlords who rent it out, but ultimately create a revolving door.” But NHS is interested in investing in not only the neighborhood infrastructure but in the neighbors as well. The goal is to have people own these homes, so they too want to invest in keeping it beautiful. She had been happy to explain to her neighbors what and who NHS is, especially after going through their resident leadership program herself. This is a ten week program that NHS holds to teach residents about keeping track of community growth, planning, assessing, documenting progress, and of course, how to communicate with community members. It’s all about how to allow the community to work together to improve itself. They also do financial training and homeownership classes that help people learn what it really means to be a homeowner and ultimately be good stewards of their community. She also applauds the efforts of Pastor Morris and the Promise Land Project. Pastor Morris of Life Kingdom Outreach Ministry in Newhallville has been an active community leader for almost 20 years in pushing back against the appeal of gang life for youth and providing alternatives in what can be a desolate place. The Promise Land Project, founded in 2011, aims to inject life into Newhallville with its prayers and messages broadcasted in the streets via bullhorn, as well as its food distribution and health care info dissemination. It also aims to, in Pastor Morris’ words, “give color to the neighborhood” with its annual street festival, bike rides, and fishing trips. It is also involved with the educational initiative, Solar Youth, that teaches kids about power and renewable energy. Ms. Cynthia recently spoke with Pastor Morris and she hopes to learn about community organizing to help her expand her own project and even work with him to get a facility. “The prototype for my favorite kind of student is the one who comes in not really knowing what to expect and becomes a team leader. I had a six year old who came in afterschool one day in her uniform. I gave her an apron of mine that was twice her size and as I was showing her how to prepare batter, she was shy and gentle. And I told her, ‘You gotta mix it baby, mix it! Get in there and mix it, baby!’ And now three years later, she comes in with the younger kids and she goes, ‘Mix it, baby. You gotta mix it, baby!’ I love to see that kind of progression.”        by Hawa Adula  “Camp means everything to me. I can be with my friends and not have to worry and I love being with the counselors. It is an escape from pain. I can be myself for a while and just feel free. I get so scared for my mom, but at Camp Kesem I can just be me.”  A Camp Kesem Camper In 2012, the number of people living with cancer was 13,776,251. As of today, the estimated number of new cases in the United States is 1,658,370. While cancer can not be biased, the National Center for Health Statistics observed that there were more cases of cancer among whites but higher death rates amongst African American’s with cancer. It is hard to remember that each statistic stands for a real person living with an incurable disease and that they are not the only ones that struggle. Their families and friends live with the pain of having a loved one diagnosed with cancer. In particular, children with parents that have been diagnosed with cancer no longer have the opportunity to live an ordinary childhood. Instead, their lives are filled with the uncertainty of whether or not their mom or dad will survive another day. This is where Camp Kesem comes in. Camp Kesem is an organization, started in 2001 by Iris Rave, that seeks to transcend the pain and uncertainty that comes with having a parent battling cancer by inviting children who have parents with cancer to attend camp. The camp is a 4-7 day overnight program headed by dedicated counselors chosen from a variety of colleges and universities around the United States. Camp Kesem started with one university, Stanford University, in 2001 and now extends to 62. In order for Camp Kesem to provide free camp, chapters at each university or college fund raise throughout the year. Some examples of fundraisers include Giving Tuesday. #Givingtuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, is a national day of giving back to charitable organizations such as Camp Kesem. All chapters get involved in Giving Tuesday and individually make find different ways to make the event unique to the specific chapter. If you know a child, or multiple, who could benefit from Kesem, sign them up! The first round of applications will open on December 15, 2015 for returning campers and the second round, which is open to everyone, will open on January 15, 2016.

As someone who grew up on the motion picture version of The Wiz (1979), can sing all the original songs, and is fiercely defensive of Nipsey Russell as the Tinman – even though he talk-sings through most of the performance – I was so excited to see how director Kenny Leon was going to translate it to a new generation of viewers. The casting was magnificent. Nineteen-year-old Shanice Williams (Dorothy) has some pipes on her, and it was a great move on Leon’s part to have Stephanie Mills, the original Broadway Dorothy play the part of Auntie Em. The costumes were colorful and rich, translating well into contemporary fashion, while also maintaining the magic of musical theater costume. Amber Riley (Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North) murdered “He’s the Wizard” and Mary J. Blige’s voice was a perfect fit for Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West (no shade). I will also give Ne-Yo his props for a heartbreaking version of “If I Could Feel.” Elijah Kelley danced with everything he had during classic,“You Can’t Win” and as well his other numbers; Michael Jackson would have been proud. And who never told us Uzo Aduba can sing? Watching her descend from the sky was life changing. All that Black girl magic up on that stage was too much for me to handle. My eyes got teary just looking at Amber Riley, Uzo Aduba and Shanice Williams interact on stage. Props to choreographer Fatima Robinson who slipped contemporary Black dances into elaborate musical numbers, mixing past and present for dance numbers that blew me away. As I watched the performance, I kept thinking of Diana Ross, Lena Horne and of course, Michael Jackson, and how well the present day cast emulated their magic. I got so wistful: I imagined my grandmother watching her favorite play as I watched Shanice Williams belt out “Home,” and recognized the timelessness of this piece of art. Perhaps the real magic in this musical lies in the fact that it has an all-Black cast (save for one white dude background dancer) with diverse voices, body types, natural hairstyles and characters in gender-nonconforming clothing. It is no wonder this show absolutely bodied previous NBC musicals. Circulating social media, there is a picture of a little Black girl standing in front of a TV, watching Uzo Aduba in all her golden-robbed, dark-skinned glory sing “If You Believe” to Shanice Williams. That image sums up the importance of this musical. Seeing magical Black people, especially magical Black women, is crucial to young Black children. Knowing that you can be magical, that you can be powerful and beautiful and talented gives you a sense of self. As Lena Horne (Glinda the Good Witch) said in the motion picture: “home is knowing your mind, your heart, your courage.” The Wiz taught me, like it taught and will continue to teach other little Black girls, that we have a home: that we have a place where we are loved and cherished. And that the place resides within ourselves.        by Ellie Pritchett  Ease on down, ease on down the road I love The Wiz. I just adore it. After two all white live musical productions (The Sound of Music and Peter Pan), you can’t even imagine how excited I was to find out that NBC was putting on a production of The Wiz this year. And then…  Cuz there may be times when you think you lost your mind This is insanity. Have you ever seen The Wizard of Oz? How can you act like The Wiz is some separate entity from The Wizard of Oz? It’s a Black retelling. You want to make a white version of a Black version of a white thing? To what end? (Don’t say anything unless you’re gonna say “oppression”). And the steps you’re taking leave you three, four steps behind  Except that I won’t. History: The Wiz is a Black version of The Wizard of Oz. It first ran in 1974. In 1978 it was made into a movie with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson that’s low-key one of the best movies ever made and, despite that, was very badly reviewed. A generation of Black folks still love it, regardless. The Wiz doesn’t just put on The Wizard of Oz with a Black cast—it’s a journey through Black tradition, particularly Black music. The musical offers Black people a sense of a belonging in the world of The Wizard of Oz—not somewhere you’d expect Black people to belong, but in this show, little Black Dorothy does! That’s why I can’t leave that tweet (and the innumerable others like it) alone. It’s that same picture of the little girl in front of the TV screen, in front of Uzo Aduba’s Glinda; she’s seeing herself, or her mother, or her aunts, in the place of that fairy princess, in a role Black people don’t play often. Just you keep on keeping on the road that you choose Last year my high school put on a production of The Wiz. I went to a pretty small public school in Center City Philadelphia. Our director, vocal director, and instrumental director were all white, so the part of this show that deals with Black issues was pretty completely purged. I even remember vividly the orchestra director (more than once) introducing The Wiz as the “pop culture” or “pop music” retelling of The Wizard of Oz, which is as much what The Wiz is as The Wizard of Oz is a fairy tale about a girl who gets lost. It just isn’t, to perform it that way drained it of its power and purpose as a show.  Don’t you give up walking cuz you gave up shoes I was, and am, affected by this show. I wasn’t someone who grew up on The Wiz; I remember watching it a few times as a child, but it wasn’t a family tradition. I rediscovered the show when the music program decided to put it on my senior year. The announcement rekindled a couple sparks in me—mostly “Why?”s, dimly remembering the movie and knowing already how it would go—and I vaguely remembered what it was like to see it as a kid… so I went and watched it again. Twice. There’s something magical about this show, especially the musical, that really resonated with me even as a teenager. The music is beautiful, the show is the right amount of silly, sometimes ridiculous, often sad, serious, powerful, but all of those things in a sort of loving way of Black people talking to Black people. Of course it’s not a perfect show, not in the slightest—but it’s damn fun. Cuz there may be times when you wish you wasn’t born The NBC production, regardless of its detractors, is well aware of its job as a Black musical. It knows exactly what its role is—to showcase Black culture and a Black journey. It makes some deliberate decisions, like including “You Can’t Win” from the movie, about the perils and paradoxes of being Black in a racist society. Even the open casting of Dorothy, which brought us new talent in nineteen-year-old Shanice Williams, preserves that implicit message that everyone belongs in Oz. And throughout the show, there’s a sense of magic and enchantment that’s so dear to the musical, the movie, The Wizard of Oz, and Oz itself—the bounce of the munchkins’ costumes, the bright, twisting yellow brick road, Amber Riley’s god-sent vocals, Ne-Yo’s magic hat that’s never left his head…  The Wiz isn’t timeless in the unchanging, ever-enjoyable way of The Wizard of Oz—it’s timeless in that it’s always applicable and adaptable in a way that makes it powerful to viewers throughout the generations.        by Nicole Chavez  June 26th, 2015 was a monumental day for many same-sex couples all across the country. Coupled with the announcement of the Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the U.S., millions of people across Facebook “showed their pride” by applying a rainbow filter to their Facebook profile picture. Although the overwhelming approval for the court’s decision was affirming, it was concurrently problematic. Numerous individuals – straight and LGBTQ+ alike – had come to the conclusion that this Supreme Court decision denoted the end of the gay rights movement, the achievement of full equality for LGBTQ+ individuals. However, in contention to the “Love Wins” messages posted by President Obama and other political figures, just because love won does not entail that justice was won overall as well.  This aforementioned case is just one of many examples of how the queer rights movement has transgressed with the fight for marriage equality to a vanilla fight for gay rights. In this narrowing of scope, even LGBTQ+ folk have disregarded the most afflicted populations within the queer community, trans/non-binary folks and queer people of color (QPOC). The focus on and victory for marriage equality is evidence of the supersession of the desires of a more privileged queer demographic over the basic needs of these trans/non-binary people and QPOC.  As the “Gay Ivy,” Yale presents itself as a microcosm of queer life in the U.S. To the concern of many students on campus, the queer culture at Yale has adopted many of the more complacent and privileged attitudes of the national gay rights movement.  This discrediting of the queer scene at Yale has occurred frequently throughout the last several weeks. In accordance with the Next Yale demonstrations taking over campus, forums have opened up for students to discuss the ways in which marginalized groups within the queer community at Yale (and society at large) have not been acknowledged and supported. In some way, the issue itself may have stemmed from the fact that Yale is a progressive and inclusive space where queer and straight spaces have become more integrated. Kyle Ranieri (pronouns: he/him), a Peer Liaison for the LGBTQ Resource Center and newly elected Co-Coordinator of the LGBTQ Co-Op believes that “that the queer community at Yale is spread out across campus. Obviously, it’s great that we have the option to be so open about who we are throughout Yale, but it can cause the core of the queer community and organizing to be inactive and empty.” As Ranieri notes, as queer individuals have become more accepted on Yale’s campus, the spaces that once served as key enclaves for queer students to mobilize and support one another have lost their impetus.  The LGBTQ Co-Op at Yale was created in 1981 by a student at the Divinity School. As is written in its mission statement, the organization was created to serve “a social function, working to provide safe spaces and meeting opportunities for queer and LGBT students” and “a political function, fighting to change policies and beliefs, at Yale and elsewhere, that are damaging to queer and LGBT people.” In its advent, the Co-Op was a political powerhouse, leading educational workshops on queer identity for straight and queer students on campus in addition to convincing the school to add sexual orientation to Yale’s anti-discrimination policy. However, since that time, the political efficacy and social awareness of the Co-Op has waned.  As some students have noted, the Co-Op has become a space that is dominated by parties and the celebration of queerness, but without critical thinking about what ongoing issues the queer community still has to tackle. Alina Yaman (pronouns: they/them), the newly elected Co-Coordinator of the Co-Op and a member of Trans@Yale, an affinity group for trans and non-binary students on campus, shared their views on the current atmosphere of the Co-Op: “In the past, I think the Co-Op has been a space where people would gather jointly to celebrate their queerness – Pride Month, IvyQ, film screenings. These things are important, but they’re not really my priority…. It’s difficult to spend time and energy on celebrating an identity when so much work still needs to be done to make sure those identities are something people feel like they can even take pride or joy in to begin with.”  In their comment, Yaman captures the primary issue of the Co-Op: students, even queer individuals, see queer identity as monolithic. Some queer students disregard people’s various backgrounds and experiences beyond Yale and ignore the intersectionality of identities and how they contribute to one’s “Yale Experience.” They assume that being at Yale, apparently a utopia for all LGBTQ+ people, ensures that every queer student’s experience is the same – filled with acceptance, acknowledgement, and an absence of discrimination. However, this is far from the case, especially for trans/non-binary and QPOC students.  Many trans, non-binary, and QPOC students face hurdles that often go unspoken of on campus. As revealed by the results of the Association of American Universities campus sexual climate survey, students that do not identify as cis-gender face an alarmingly higher incidence of sexual assault. Compared to the 18.1% of female and male undergrads who reported experiencing sexual assault via force or incapacitation, 28.4% of undergrads who identified as “other genders” were victims of assault. Many QPOC students at Yale confront the issue of not being out to their family and home communities, due to the fear of being disowned or estranged. The Co-Op has not done enough to cater to the needs of these populations within the queer community at Yale. Yaman points to the Co-Op’s need to re-establish its priorities: “How can [the Co-Op] celebrate National Coming Out Day when we’re not fighting for better resources for people whom being outed to their families means being cut off completely?” Moreover, Ranieri points out how the white-washed atmosphere of the Co-Op has warded off QPOC and non-binary students: “[These students] have not always felt that the Co-Op was a safe space that is sensitive to the issues that QPOC and trans/non-binary people face every day. This notion has been reinforced by the dearth of programming by the Co-Op pertaining to these issues. Although, the previous Coordinator of the Co-Op, Rianna Johnson-Levy, has done a tremendous job in addressing this.” Ranieri and Yaman got together with several other trans/non-binary and QPOC to run as a single board for the Co-Op elections that occurred this past Monday, December 7. In assembling this diverse group of people, Yaman shared that their main objective was to “make the Co-Op a more radical space.” They stated that “through our leadership and presence alone, we are already showing our commitment to representing and working for underrepresented identities within the queer community.” Ranieri added that in addition to being radical, the Co-Op should serve as a safe space, where QPOC and trans and non-binary students “feel comfortable, and also affirmed in their identities.”  Their ticket for the Co-Op board consisted of the following individuals: Alina Yaman and Kyle Ranieri for Co-Coordinators, Karen Marks for Secretary, Steph MacLean for Treasurer, and Eli Ceballo-Countryman, Sophie Freeman, and Ellie Pritchett for Social Chairs. According to Ranieri, “the composition of our board was strategic so that we have inherent partnership with other groups.” He points out his involvement with the Native American Cultural Center, Yaman’s association with Trans@Yale and Sappho, a queer womyn’s social group, and Eli’s position on the Black Student Alliance at Yale’s Queer Caucus, as evidence of the intersectionality present on the board. With this inherent diversity, Ranieri says that the board “hopes to forge relationships between these communities and make the Co-Op the meeting place of all these identities … through collaboration with cultural centers and queer affinity groups such as [Queer ; Asian] and De Colores.”  On the night of elections this past Monday, other members of the Co-Op who planned on running for the board withdrew their tickets unexpectedly. Yaman views their withdrawal as an act of support during this “necessary and historic change for the Co-Op.” They says that the newly elected board recognizes and appreciates their investment in the Co-Op and hopes for their support in the board’s initiative to incite change within the queer community on campus. Yaman adeptly captured the role of the Co-Op in implementing reform on campus: “The Co-Op should be a driving force for change. It should be a constantly evolving organization that represents the [queer] community adequately. There is no queer experience, and that needs to be something the Co-Op is always mindful of.”  Under this new leadership, it is now guaranteed that the Co-Op will adhere to its mission statement in acting “on two fronts: first, as a Co-Op, a unified voice taking action [and] second, as a multitude of different voices … and individuals” in creating a safe and empowering space for non-binary, trans, and queer people at Yale.         by Micah Jones What would Martin Luther King Jr. do? It seems to be the question at the center of every MLK day celebration. In many ways, it speaks to the process by which real, complex, flawed people are hollowed out in order to make martyrs. As we celebrate this national holiday in his honor, we ought to reflect on the question of what role the dead have to play in the questions of the present. We make people into martyrs as part of a broader project of creating a usable history from the past. The past is the things that have happened before the present; history is how we have made meaning out of the past. Therefore, asking what a historical figure would think about the present day tells us more about the historical narratives we’re constructing in the present than the actual events of the past. Martin Luther King, Jr. died on April 4th 1968. Whatever thoughts and opinions he might have had about the events of April 5th, 1968 or January 18th, 2016 are inaccessible to us now. People can and often do change. If Eldridge Cleaver, a leading figure in the Black Panther Party, had died in 1971 instead of 1998, he would never have become a conservative republican and a Mormon. Simply put, we cannot say with any degree of certainty at all who Martin Luther King would have become. We can however, discuss who he was. There is a significant body of evidence on King’s relationships to women within the movement. One woman in particular who played a strong role in King’s early development was Ella Baker. By the time she met King, Baker had been a Civil Rights activist for decades. By 1943, she had become the highest ranking woman in the NAACP. At the time, King would only have been fourteen. In the wake of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Baker along with Bayard Rustin and Stanley Levinson, came up with the idea to create the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and organized its founding. Because the ministers who made up the SCLC did not have any organizing experience, Ella Baker was the SCLC’s first paid staffer brought on to help organize their early projects. Despite the fact that Baker was older than most of the ministers, more experienced, and essential to the SCLC’s survival, she was constantly disrespected by King and the other ministers in the SCLC. It is important to resist the urge to dismiss this and other acts of sexism as merely a product of the time. Baker was vocally pushing back against the sexism she experienced, as she experienced it. Bayard Rustin, a longtime activist, was Baker’s friend and frequent collaborator who respected her skills regardless of her gender. There were opportunities for King to take a more progressive stance on gender equality but he did not. If King’s past was any predictor of his future, he probably would not have been at the cutting edge of women’s liberation. He very well could have changed him mind, but he also could have doubled down on his conservative notions of gender and worked against the women’s liberation movement. It is a little acknowledged possibility that if King had lived to be a part of the world today, he may have found himself deeply out of step with what the Civil Rights Movement has become. We’ll never know, because Martin Luther King Jr. is dead and this is what it means to be dead. There is no more progress, no more growth, no more change left for MLK. Instead of imagining that we can grow and change him we must focus on how we, the living, can grow and change ourselves. This means critically examining King’s life and work. It means building upon the parts of his ideology that fit our present needs and repudiating or abandoning parts of his ideology that do not. This is not a comment on King. It is a comment on ourselves. Most of all, we need to be more aggressive about reclaiming our moral authority. We have as much of a right to decide what we think is right and what we think is wrong in our day as those who came before us. We do not need the approval of our ghosts and our martyrs. They cannot give it, and the time we spend debating these questions is better spent working for change. This Martin Luther King Day, let’s stop asking “What Would Martin Luther King Do.” Rather, in our quest for a usable history, let’s ask what we can learn from what Martin Luther King did, and put those skills to use in pursuit of our own dreams.        by Sarah Pearl Heard  “Education, like movements, starts in the streets,” said Professor Hazel Carby, closing a teach-in on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day sponsored by various departments at Yale. Carby’s declaration rang through the high ceilings of the old-Yale gothic tower of SSS. The irony was not lost on the crowd, and a slight chuckle rumbled through. Though attendees were the farthest from “the streets” as could be, “Keywords in Critical Ethnic Studies” aspired to describe experiences outside this literal ivory tower. The day began in an overflowing Sudler Hall with remarks by Dean Holloway including a reading from his book Jim Crow Wisdom. His words followed an introduction by professor and acclaimed poet Richard Deming. “A liberal education must be an anti-racist education,” he said. Then the crowd split into roundtable seminars about the keywords featured, which ranged from recent buzzwords like reparations, “illegal”, first generation, and immigration to more academic terms such as decolonizing feminism, coalitions beyond identity politics, inclusion, and racialized space. Students and professors alike found the seminars rigorous and engaging. Matthew Johnson, a professor in the African American studies department closed his seminar by saying, “in Computer Science, we expect the students to outpace us. This is true in the humanities. They have capabilities of understanding the politics of difference that we don’t possess. We are behind the curve. ” Matthew Jacobson described a media that tells and ultimately shapes stories about people of color without the education required to discuss racial issues accurately or in proper context. “To get an education in modern times, is to get an education in ethnic studies.” The teach-in addressed the growing visibility of these issues by breaking down keywords surfacing in the media. Seminar leaders connected historical and present racism to the day-to-day experiences and identities of students on campus. A group of graduate students organized the event in response to the call for a revamped ethnic studies program from NextYale, the undergraduate coalition that ignited a mass anti-racist movement on campus last semester. Anthony Reed, a professor in the African American studies department, discussed the tension between academic excellence and their political commitments. “We take what we learn back to our communities, and this is where the change happens,” he said. An ethnic studies education is a part of how people of color can fight institutionalized white supremacy, Reed continued. “Ethnic studies is the work of making the future better.” To people overwhelmed by the pressure and daunting task of educating themselves and others about this essential task, he advised “Actively engage in your education because you are inspired to, but it’s not your sole responsibility to always be that person, that sole person raising your voice. You’ll grind yourself right down.” A full list of the program, including seminar topics and faculty and student organizers, can be found here. &nbsp; [1] Please see: Sean Abbott-Klafter, Lohl Berning, and Tenaya Lafore, An Open Letter to All Those Concerned about the Labor Movement, 2009, and Ned Resnikoff, When the Unions the Boss, 2013. Thanks to Kaneesha Parsard for directing attention to these sources, and for her feedback on an earlier draft of this letter.        As members of the Coordinating Committee, the elected leadership of GESO, we write to our colleagues who drafted “An Open Letter to GESO Leadership,” published on January 25, 2016. As a leadership group made up overwhelmingly of women, people of color and LGBTQ people, we face many of the challenges outlined in your letter. We struggle to balance the many hours of work we dedicate to make our university a more just and equal place and to gain a formal voice for our union, with our many academic and personal commitments. Many of us do this work as we push through the struggles we face personally to claim a space at Yale. We appreciate your recognition “of the powerful work this union has done over the last two decades to support marginalized university employees and New Haven residents.” We are proud of our work to make Yale a more equitable place through years of struggle over graduate student and faculty diversity, support for graduate families and international scholars, Yale’s role as a neighbor and employer in New Haven, and the impact of Yale’s investment policies. As you know, we are also currently engaged in ongoing fights to address inadequacies in funding and mental health care, issues that disproportionately affect underrepresented graduate students, who are likelier to occupy positions of precarity at Yale. Recognizing the seriousness and urgency of the concerns raised in your letter, in the coming days we will grapple with how to most fully respond. We deeply hope that we can build from our shared desire for a union to work together for a stronger and more equitable union and university. We are committed to building a democratic organization that supports and encourages the leadership and membership of graduate employees from all backgrounds. We have developed our campaigns through thousands of conversations with our colleagues across campus; these campaigns continue to evolve through ongoing dialogue. Our union is not perfect and our members have a wide variety of opinions, in particular about how we organize. All of us have made mistakes as we learn how to organize—we are not professional labor organizers, but academics who believe that a union is an essential step on the path to a more just and equitable university. However, a union is only worth having if it truly represents the consensus of its members. As we continue to try to build that consensus, we invite those who share our vision that another Yale is possible to talk with us about how to improve our organizational practices, and how to build a union that more effectively resists reproducing Yale’s entrenched power structures. Specifically, in response to your three asks “that union leadership immediately devote time to rethinking its organizing practices in order to reduce harm and oppression within GESO, and that it present a plan to its members in the coming months,” and that GESO “hire an external adviser to suggest, supervise, and oversee changes,” we are committed to taking the following steps: 1) We will reestablish the GESO Equal Rights and Access Standing Committee, co-chaired by Charles Decker and LiLi Johnson, to lead us and all interested members in conversations about organizing tactics in the context of campaigning. This committee will convene a forum open to all interested graduate employees in the coming weeks. 2) We will reach out to Race Forward: The Center for Racial Justice Innovation and other external organizations regarding possibilities for providing training and guidance. 3) We will release a statement before spring break with a summary of our progress and next steps. Abbey Agresta, History        by Yonas Takele  The 1990s were an era marked by the proliferation of such phenomena as pagers, Bob Saget, and the reign of Michael Jordan. The 90s also mark the beginning of a musical phenomena, gangsta rap. With the rise of such apostolic rap industry pioneers as Tupac, The Notorious BIG, and groups like N.W.A. and Wu-Tang Clan, this decade pushed the entire lyrical envelope. Not only were artists expected to present their greatest triple-entendres, rappers were also expected to tell their truth on their records. Whether that truth was related to police brutality, the harsh realities of ghetto life, or the albeit-sometimes-exaggerated truths of their profound wealth, rappers from this decade were the first to elevate the platform of rap music towards this more cohesive story-telling. For West Coast rappers specifically, this progression was all done with a backdrop of rolling bass lines and the characteristic California sound. Our entire conception of West Coast gangsta rap, as exemplified by such tracks Gin and Juice, Ambitionz az a Ridah, and It Was A Good Day, has been intimately linked to the 90s proliferation of rap music. However, with the rise of such artists like Vince Staples, I think it is time to re-think everything we thought we knew about the golden states rap portfolio. Born Vincent Staples, this 22-year-old rapper hails from the Ramona Park neighborhood of Long Beach California. Having grown up around gang life all throughout his teen years, Vince has cultivated quite the nuanced view of his neighborhood and the world around him. Never having been a victim of gang violence himself and having spent a sizable portion of his younger years living in a safe neighborhood, his musical persona turns many of our pre-formed assumptions of West Coast rap on their head. The first escape from convention in Vince’s discography stems from his production. The booming bass and clever sampling many of us are used to are replaced with muted bass lines overlaid under either shrill or subdued horn lines, a la Blue Suede and Norf Norf. Even the more commercially successful Señorita sports a similar gritty production style. This sound concoction produces an often disorienting effect quite unsimilar to the predictable rhythms of Staples’ predecessors. Vince’s lyrical content, described in one word, is jarring. His Hell Can Wait and Summertime ‘06 tapes are a marathon tour-de-force. Whether he’s fabricating exploits as a California Crip or children becoming the collateral damage of gang warfare, his bars are delivered in a relentless stream. His flow displays absolutely no remorse. He delivers hooks like, “I ain’t never ran from nothing but the police,” or “Young graves get the bouquets… Hope I outlive them red roses” followed up quickly with stories of even greater ferocity and mania (i.e. Jump Off the Roof). Vince Staples’ music is violent. This violence is not romanticized or placed in a production framing that distracts us from its true nature. It is spoken plainly. With the Yale Spring Fling Committee’s decision to bring Vince Staples to campus for the April concert, I question whether there are many on this campus who are ready for that.        Eshe Sherley  When it was announced that Janelle Monáe was going to headline this year’s Spring Fling, I may or may not have wailed for ten plus minutes in public. And I don’t have a bit of shame; because Monáe encompasses both the resistive and universal aspects of the long history of Black popular music through her intermingling of throwback, current, and futuristic sound profiles. Monáe started her career in the Atlanta University Center, which is the home of three of historically Black colleges and universities: Spelman, Morehouse, and Clark Atlanta. Legend has it that at this time, she was a regular fixture on campus – performing and hanging out while living in a nearby boarding house. During this time, Monáe was also working on the unreleased album The Audition, which she self-distributed through her collective, the Wondaland Arts Society, around 2003. The Audition, now a collectible item, introduces Monáe’s alter ego, Cindi Mayweather, a cyborg who, after falling in love with a human, is sentenced to being dissembled. Now on the run, Cindi emerges as a messianic figure as her escape turns into a movement to end the oppression of cyborgs everywhere. However, even though the beginnings of the funky, synthy, hybrid sounds, as well as the thematic elements that characterize Monáe’s later work are emerging, most of the album is dominated by a more traditional RnB sound, inflected with some funky elements. And so as much as The Audition portended the future, it also highlights Monáe’s roots in the wide-ranging pantheon of Black RnB, Pop, Soul and Funk classics. Her next album, The Electric Lady, elaborates on these themes. The album, at a very full but entertaining 19 songs that clock in at a little over an hour, showcases the range of Monáe’s influences – from the classic 60s RnB of “It’s Code,” to “Ghetto Woman,” which sounds like it could have been written and composed by 70s Stevie Wonder, to a reggae, Lauryn Hill influenced detour Monáe takes in the song “What an Experience,” to the sexy, modern RnB of the fourth single off the album, and so far its most popular song – “Primetime,” featuring Miguel. The album also showcases her politics. Janelle is all about the totality of the potential of Black art to touch people. She is just as likely to write the more traditional anthem to female self empowerment (see: Electric Lady) as she is to write songs that are literally for the revolution (see: Hell You Talmbout). She considers low-income women of color living in neighborhoods across the country serious song material – and not in the tradition of “I love my mama” hip hop songs that put mothers on pedestals rather than engage with them as people (see: Ghetto Woman). And as much as she is about writing music to lift up people who are struggling, she also writes about Black joy and sexuality, aka the turn up (See: Yoga and Givin Them What They Love). And she manages to perform all this not just through her music, but also through every thing else that goes into her artistry. For any of you that haven’t seen this woman perform, don’t get too drunk on Spring Fling so that you can appreciate the gift the Spring Fling Committee has bestowed on us. She is high energy, expressive – a modern embodiment of a long tradition of masterful Black performance. She’s a little bit James Brown – and even though she’s from Missouri, a little bit Atlanta homegirl too. It’s a powerful and entertaining mix. The sound Monáe developed between The Audition and The Electric Lady is both why her music can be described as “pop” or “accessible” while simultaneously producing some seriously powerful Black girl magic. Though the two aren’t mutually exclusive, often, Black girl magic goes unrecognized. Monáe has somehow figured out how to make hers legible without being as thoroughly pigeonholed as solely an RnB or Hip Hop artist as other successful Black entertainers who clearly have mass appeal. In other words, in a music industry landscape that pigeonholes someone like Rihanna, who is even more than a mainstream pop artist than Monáe, Monáe’s sound has managed to escape categorization and still be successful. And it is this escape from categorization that is also at the heart of everything else that goes into Monáe as an artist beyond her sound. Her aesthetic. Her lyrics. Even her approach toward her public personae has a kind of hybridity that escapes definition. Monáe is intensely private. She wants you to focus on her music and her artistry, but that artistic product is also not running away from her actual (and alleged) identities – it is an unabashedly Black, woman-centric, class conscious, and one could argue, queer, product she is offering us, even as she, particularly on the topic of her sexuality, isn’t interested in allowing her life to be picked over by the media. As ridiculous my quote was to the YDN when I said that Janelle Monáe was the best thing to happen to this campus in “a billion” years, I meant it. Monáe speaks to people of color, and particularly Black people, in a way that’s specific, important, and unprecedented on this campus. But she’s also just a badass. Or as she put it in an interview, “I think I’m cool. […] I am definitely in tune with the things that make me unique, and I use them as my super powers.”        by Ashia Ajani A few days ago, Wiz Khalifa tweeted about a strain of weed known as “KK.” Kanye West, likely in hopes of manufacturing a publicity stunt, responded virulently, insisting that Khalifa was talking about West’s wife, Kim Kardashian. In a Twitter rant he managed to compare himself to a God (typical Kanye), bully Khalifa’s child, and drag Amber Rose (the mother of Khalifa’s child and ex-partner or both Khalifa and Kanye) into it. Although Kanye later apologized for badmouthing a child, Amber Rose quickly fired back this tweet, which began the hashtag #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch: later explaining that she never would’ve gotten involved in the feud if Kanye hadn’t brought her child into this. Looking at the incident on its own doesn’t give much in the way of newsworthy material. It doesn’t seem fair to aggrandize the actions of a few celebrities on a platform rife with outlandish commentary. However, the journalistic responses to the Twitter feud shed an important light on how differently Black women are critiqued with regards to expressing anger compared to Black men. Many journalists have glazed over Kanye’s sexist tweets and honed in on whether or not Amber’s exposure of Kanye’s sexual preferences is homophobic. Many times in his lyrics, tweets and interviews, Kanye has shamed Amber Rose as a bad mother, former sex worker and the development of her appearance since their break up. He has constantly stood by the actions of the Kardashians in endorsing Tyga’s controversial relationship with Kylie Jenner and even fetishized his own daughter by comparing her future body type to that of her mother’s. (It would take a whole different article to talk about Kanye’s obsession with light-skinned/non-white women). To say that Kanye West got what he deserved would be an understatement. If one were to look at the demographic of people who have a history of standing by Kanye West, or just simply sidestepping to allow for further critique of Amber Rose, it consists mostly of notoriously misogynistic Black men (I’m looking at you Charlamagne) and white queer bloggers. And while the latter has an important voice in the politics of calling out homophobic and queer-phobic actions, I think it is imperative to hear the voices of Black queer authors on the subject. So I’ll take a jab at it. Amber Rose is still growing as an activist and advocate for women’s liberation. While I never fully forgave Amber Rose herself for Light Girls, I’m still a solid supporter for all that she embodies in terms of body positivity, reclamation of womanhood and safe sex. Our responses to this Twitter feud speak louder than Rose’s initial claims. This article from Black Girl Dangerous sums up the need for Kanye to refute such claims, and why it is so harmful for appreciators of hip-hop culture to endorse the stereotype that ass-play is feminine and emasculating. However, it still doesn’t really make sense to me to constantly attack her choices and her responses to Kanye West’s obvious slut shaming. When you look at Kanye’s history of blame and problematic behavior, and how we still regard him as an infallible artist, it exposes our own internalized sexism and inability to put the same boundaries on men as we do women, especially Black men. Critiquing his actions and his commentary doesn’t take away from his lyrical genius. What it really comes down to is Kanye’s inability to recognize is his own internalized homophobia and misogynoir, and Amber’s speedy ability to keep him humble. #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch” is a reminder not to cast judgment on someone else’s sexual history, when yours is just as- if not more so- colorful.        by Eleanor Pritchett Since the beginning of the spring semester, three Black Yale students have each launched their own personal websites. From music reviews to twist-out hair tutorials, these blogs come at a time of blossoming self-expression of students of color in the wake of the racial justice movement in the fall. Spotifly takes on Spring Fling and orchestral riots “I’d been thinking of doing something like this for a while,” says Calhoun junior Yonas Takele. Something like this, evidently, is Spotifly, a budding journal of Takele’s ever-evolving music tastes. He’s off to a strong start with three articles up on the bold, white-on-black front page grid, including a spotlight on recently-announced Spring Fling performer Vince Staples, cross-posted to our Arts ; Culture section. He has three more coming this week, though he doesn’t anticipate to remain so prolific.  More than once, he referred to his project as “deeply personal,” as he “charts [his] trajectory” through his musical explorations. In his post about radio.string.quartet.vienna, he begins: “I first learned the power that music could have when I was about 12 years old…” Inspired by his middle-school orchestra teacher, he became fascinated by a ballet performance in Paris at the turn of the century that was so dissonant it incited a violent riot. When the young Takele found a video of the performance, he was “completely immobilized by this piece of art,” a sensation he felt again for the first time listening to radio.string.quartet.vienna’s “ensnaring” warped soundscape, with jazz, rock and funk influences. Spotifly is also an opportunity to “connect and cooperate with friends,” Takele says. In his most recent post, he interviews the Yale electronic pop pair known as Opia, whose new single “Falling” is rapidly making rounds on the internet.  Takele says his classical training in voice and upright bass gave him his ear, but his love for music really came from his late brother, who, despite his inability to communicate because of his cerebral palsy, loved sound. Any kind of sound, “from the sound of a plastic bag rustling to Michael Jackson.” “I’ve seen the real impact music can have on a person,” Takele says. “I’m exploring what I like, what I don’t like. I’ve spent the last few years being more intentional about what I listen to.” Spotifly is a chronicle of the “weird shit” one Yale student listens to, to see if he can reach others, and form a following of music lovers.  Who Is Like Micah keeps it upbeat Stiles sophomore Micah Mingo brings herself to the web in the pink pastel, bubbly blog Who Is Like Micah. Having renewed her positive outlook after a difficult period in her life, Mingo’s profile on the front page identifies her as a “Writer. Geek. Naturalista. Crafter. Carefree Black Girl. Jesus Girl.” Reading Mingo’s posts about her knitting project gone “chunky,”  the “Forest” productivity app, and Game of Thrones, it’s impossible not to feel calm and centered. Mingo’s blog also deals with her faith and her relationship to God. “This is the age where most of us stray from our faith, but I didn’t see anything being done to address that,” she says. Her favorite post so far is about her name, which means “Who is like God,” after which the blog is named.   Her name, Micah, had caused her anxiety throughout her life, being traditionally male and recognizably Black. The post describes her path toward understanding the beauty of her name, heralding this new positive phase in her life. “I’ve always wanted to be a writer,” Mingo says, lamenting that she hasn’t been finding as much time for her passion as she wants to. If God created her to be an artist, she says, she isn’t fulfilling herself.   “If you want to do something you’ll find time for it.” Mingo is currently working on a series on time management, scheduling, organization, and productivity.  “The blog is its own accountability coach,” she says. If she’s giving advice she’s obligated to be following it. “It’s equal parts for myself and others,” she says.  “If you write from your heart it strikes a chord with people. If you write something with only your audience in mind it’s not coming from your heart.” Currently Mingo is thinking about expanding her audience by making a foray into hair tutorials. feelindiasporic centers your Blackness Saybrook senior and DOWN writer Karléh Wilson has embarked on a quest to bring Black and African diaspora artists into the foreground of her new website, feelindiasporic.  “We have to put out our own stuff,” she says, an idea which for her came straight out of the #OscarsSoWhite critique and Jada Pinkett Smith’s public call for Black artists. The groovy, visual single-page scrolling blog curates reviews and promotions of mostly Black underground artists. The goal, she says, is to help artists from marginalized communities reach new networks and eventually connect with producers. The blog is for the artists, who Wilson hopes to help work in the industry on their own terms. “My father works in entertainment,” she says, “I know how the entertainment industry works.” Many talented artists, especially those of color, go largely unrecognized even when their work is featured in popular songs. “It’s problematic that we don’t get to consume our artists the right way,” Wilson says.  When Black artists make a blip on the Billboard charts and drop off, it isn’t fair to their listeners.  And then there’s a problem with the consumption of Black music and culture. In her review of Black artists’ covers of “Hello” by Adele found on YouTube, she included a New Orleans bounce remix, sharing a hugely popular art form in her home state. Placing it next to various island/reggae renditions, she bridges the geographic distance between these Black communities and “makes sure [she] can control the narrative on people’s music.” Wilson wants to make visual art as central to feelindiasporic as music. “Visual art is so intrinsic to who we are,” she says, mentioning that artists who create even the album covers don’t get proper recognition. “We’re influenced by Black people all over the world,” Wilson says. Feeling the diaspora, Black people worldwide can look at art from thousands of miles across the globe, and recognize it, she says.  “That’s Black; that’s mine.”         by Arturo Pineda  When you hear that Juanes and John Legend are collaborating, you would expect a new hit single to drop. Instead, it was announced that Juanes and Legend are working on a film that documents the practice of crimmigation from beginning to end. Crimmigration is not simply the intersection of criminal law and immigration. Yolanda Vázquez, a law professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, defines crimmigration as, “…an institutional structure in which criminal and immigration law have merged in various ways to create a singular and distinct concept with its own structure of laws, procedures, and practices.” The film currently in production explores the mass incarceration of immigrants and how it directly causes the incarceration industry to thrive. The more detainees, the more funding the prison centers receive from the federal government. Thanks to the “bed mandate” bill of 2009, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is required to keep 34,000 immigrants behind every day. This bill equates to 2 billion dollars worth of business in a year. On January 20th, Juanes and Legend visited the Eloy Immigration Detention Center in Arizona to sing to the 1,500 immigrant detainees. Most detainees are being prepped to be deported to their respective countries, while another group is battling to retain their legal residency in the United States. These 1,500 constitute a minute fraction of the roughly 1 million Latinxs and African-Americans currently behind bars. Although Latinxs and African-Americans make up 25% of the US Population, they compromise almost 60% of all incarcerations. The collaboration between Juanes and Legend is significant because it demonstrates just one of the intersections of the Latinx and African-American identities and interests. The more conversations that we have about the prison industrial complex and the Afro-Latinx identity, the more space we have for unity and understanding.        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon On January 25th, American Studies and Ethnicity, Race, and Migration (ER;M) associate professor Birgit Rasmussen posted to her Facebook wall: “Craziest shopping period ever is drawing to a close.” Rasmussen—whose impending departure from Yale College comes in the midst of an exodus of ethnic studies faculty—teaches “Race and Gender in American Lit,” the most popular course this semester. Student interest in “Race and Gender” reached a crisis point during shopping period when as many as 622 students scrambled to secure spots in a limited number of writing sections, encountering technical difficulties from the Registrar’s Office as they did so. Why the commotion? Yale alum and ER;M major Javier Cienfuegos ’15 credits the Next Yale movement. “Many students had no idea [race and gender] were issues they needed to be educated about,” he says. “Now that students know they have this gap in knowledge, they want to learn.” Others, like sophomore Yuni Chang, point to Professor Rasmussen’s personal appeal: “She never fails to show up for her students, especially women of color,” says Chang. “She’s just an incredible person.” Logistical complications, the work of Next Yale, and Rasmussen’s tremendous popularity play into the “Race and Gender” saga. However, by themselves, they paint a picture that is dangerously incomplete. To place too much emphasis on failed logistics is to ignore that enrollment in “Race and Gender” reflects the ongoing fight for ethnic studies at Yale. To cast the shopping frenzy solely as an aftershock of Next Yale’s work is to continue a problematic journalistic tradition in which POC student activism and intellectual tastes garner attention simply because they disrupt the mainstream, while their substance is ignored. In other words, “Race and Gender” isn’t just breaking news—it’s a course with a message, and that message matters. Junior Ava Tomasula y García explains: I used to be an English major. But in my English classes […] a text’s racism or sexism would be bracketed and moved to the side so that the class could move on to the “real ideas” of the poem—as if what matters were lying untouched underneath all that surface contamination. For me, studying literature and language is a way to decode power structures—yet these politics were missing from too many of my classes. In light of the course’s tremendous popularity and academic merit, it comes as no surprise that Professor Rasmussen’s impending departure has provoked mass confusion and outrage. Many see it as an indictment of Yale’s tenure process and evidence of the administration’s hostility to ethnic studies. Indeed, Rasmussen never even went up for tenure—despite a unanimous vote of confidence from senior American Studies faculty in 2013, the Humanities Tenure Appointments and Promotions Committee refused to promote her to a slightly higher (still untenured) position along the tenure track. Her appeal was overturned. On Facebook, Rasmussen has been vocal about her frustration with the university’s lack of support for ethnic studies. “The courses in our major are filled to capacity and beyond,” she wrote on 20 January 2016. “When do we get the faculty lines and tenure promotions to match our groundbreaking work?” Is universal matriculation in “Race and Gender” the key to decolonizing the academy? Probably not. And yet the outpouring of student commitment to ethnic studies this semester must be cause for hope. In the words of the professor herself: At the end of some very intense days fielding hundreds of student emails, I have to think this means something: I have 18 Ethnicity, Race, and Migration majors in my final seminar, [and] 622 students […] hung on for dear life to a class called Race and Gender in American Lit where [several student-poets] will share with us the magic of Spoken Word as we finish a semester-long journey that begins now. Clearly the path to adequate institutional support for ethnic studies at Yale will be long and fraught. From all of us at DOWN, we thank Professor Birgit Rasmussen for her tireless commitment and contribution.        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon (1) It only looks manageable from a safe distance.

But when it comes to discerning suspicions of terrorism, visuals are not the only cues. Evident in the diatribes, often described as a policy statements, of U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump, is a rising rhetoric of Islamophobia that one could liken to the terrorism he claims to want to abolish. Earlier on in the election season, people across the political spectrum disregarded Trumps bid for the GOPs nomination as a joke. The Huffington Post, for example, sarcastically posted all of its coverage of Donald Trump and his campaign under the Entertainment section next to stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette. However, eyebrows were soon raised after Trump made an announcement after the San Bernardino shooting in early December, calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. This overt aggression and xenophobia in Trumps regard for Muslims is concerning. The scapegoating strategy that he uses in his policy recommendations, such as closing the borders to all Muslims, which includes American Muslims working abroad for the American government and military, and creating a database of all Muslims in the U.S. and forcing them to wear I.D. badges, emulates the terroristic racism perpetuated by Hitler in Nazi Germany. This political rhetoric cannot be ignored, not only because its pre-genocidal implications, but also because of the stark support from the American public. NBC News and Wall Street Journal ran several polls to gauge the American publics reaction to Trumps petition to close the borders to Muslims. Their results revealed that 42% of Republic voters are in favor of banning Muslim entry, with only 36% explicitly against it. One of the primary reasons for which Trump is being given the attention and political power to disseminate such detrimental ideology and bolster an Islamophobic mob mentality within the American public is the narrow confines through which America  and the remainder of Western society  defines terrorism. Merriam-Webster defines terrorism as the systematic use of terror, especially as a means of coercion. Terror, subsequently, is defined as violent or destructive acts committed by groups in order to intimidate a population or government into granting their demands. But what people refuse to realize is that Trumps demagogic speech is not a meaningless monologue meant to entertain. In fact, it is terrorism. Donald Trump is enthusing American with a white supremacist ideology that is indirectly mobilizing people to implement these ideologies in the form of hate crimes against Muslims and, in general, against people of Middle Eastern descent. It was on December 7th that Trump called to block Muslims from entering into the U.S. borders. Only one day following this incident was Sarker Haque, a 53-year old Muslim who owns Fatima Food Mart in Astoria, Queens randomly assaulted by a man who claimed to kill Muslims. This brainwashing rhetoric trickles down to even the youngest of our society. On December 12, not even a week after Trump declared his new policy statement, was a seventh grader in Ohio charged with ethnic intimidation and aggravated menacing for threating to shoot a sixth grader. He called the younger boy a towel head, a terrorist, and accused him of being the son of ISIS who was going to bomb him. This past Wednesday, February 3rd, President Obama made his first Presidential visit to a mosque. Although he faced criticism by some for having waited until the end of his second term to visit an Islamic house of worship and speak directly with the Muslim community, the message he shared tackled the escalating levels of Islamophobia seen in the election, and nation overall, during these last several months: [Americans] have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone. And that includes against Muslims here in the United States. As active and educated citizenry, we should hold ourselves, as Obama said, accountable and not be bystanders to bigotry. By calling others out on their Islamophobic rhetoric, we can abolish the misconception that pervades America that terrorism and Muslim are synonymous. By acknowledging the influence of the ideology upheld by Trumps campaign and actively responding to it instead of ignoring it as absurdity, we can serve as better allies to the Muslim community. Even better, when conversations turn to the topic of Muslims, instead of focusing solely on how we can eradicate radical terrorism (including that perpetuated by non-Muslims), why not discuss ways in which we can bring about radical justice for Muslims, both those living in and outside of the United States?        by Sarah Pearl Heard and Sebi Medina-Tayac Roast ‘em both        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon Hello, all you sexy scholars.

Roots, Rebirth, and Renaissance is the theme of this year’s Black History Month at the Afro-American Cultural Center, and what better way to introduce that theme than a community-wide family dinner and discussion? With the driving music of a drum ensemble spilling into the street and a homey spread of food of the Black Diaspora crowning the front of an E-room decked out in round tables, it’s hard to see the House as set for anything but a family event.   When filmmaker Thomas Allen Harris takes the stage at Dean Nelson’s introduction, he asks, “Who still has family albums?” The room raises its hands, of course.  Then fewer, as he asks who has physical books for their photos, then who still updates their albums, until hardly a hand is seen.   Harris’s work is in the study of how Black people make and participate in history through film and through photography.  His award-winning 2014 documentary Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People places the dark imagery of slavery’s pseudoscience and Jim Crow’s murderous propaganda in conversation with the joyfulness of Black family photos, tracing the history of Black photography from the first daguerreotypes through to the modern day.  The Black family doesn’t appear in museums, but it does appear in family albums, and Harris’s work is in facilitating a rebirth of a more complete American family photo album by illuminating the continuity of Black history.  Through a Lens Darkly’s accompanying project, the Digital Diaspora Family Reunion (DDFR) roadshow, brings that reclamation of history home to people across the country.  DDFR is a traveling project that allows people to have their family photos admired and preserved, and for them to tell and record stories about their families. According to Harris’s website, DDFR “engages audiences to discover connections between their own family archives and the film’s historical narrative,” and to recognize the historical value of their own records.    When Harris asked for volunteers at the Houses kickoff event to show family photos, maybe he wasn’t expecting much from the small crowd.  But never underestimate how much people love talking about their roots. The most enthralling and emotional piece of the program, this hour allowed the audience to enter into and understand the lives of the volunteers and their families; over the course of seven storytellers, the audience saw late beloveds, family reunions, graduations, birthday parties, and wedding photos, accompanied by beautiful and passionate stories told the way people can only talk about their families.  Dean Jonathan Holloway was the first to present a picture.  He handed it to the man at the projector, and we saw a car window, a smiling, just-married couple—Dean Holloway and his new bride.   In the face of this new semester, where it seems the community of people of color at Yale must find ways to return to a business that is no longer usual, it is eminently important to foster a renaissance of community, a rebuilding of the Yale family. “The drums beckon us to return home,” Dean Nelson said of the House in her introduction.  Thomas Allen Harris’s reunion underscored that sense of family the House seeks to foster, and the events that will round out Black History Month this year seek to do the same.          by Carlene Ervin Last week I was a competitor in the “Don’t-be-triggered-by-disturbing-Facebook-content-Olympics” when I stumbled upon a particularly perplexing article. Let’s just say I came in last for my event. A white man’s picture is next to Michael Jackson. On first glance I think, “Is this going to be some bullshit ass article about the type of white person Michael was trying to turn into?” Fortunately, my worst fears weren’t realized  something even worse happened instead. Joseph Fiennes, a white man, was cast to play Jackson in a British comedy. My first thought:         On the heels of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, the move to cast a white actor to play a Black man (no matter how much Jackson bleached his skin) seemed downright disrespectful. But they did slightly resembled each other. I was so conflicted. My Black-senses were tingling and telling me, “THIS IS SO WRONG” but whiteness was working in the background like,  So then I thought, “What would Michael, the king of skin bleaching, want?” I called in reinforcements in the form of my sister, a self-proclaimed guru of all things MJ. She hit me with that,  I asked her who she would have play Michael to portray him at that stage in his life. She responded in a way that most people on Twitter did, “I don’t know who [I would choose] but what I do know, he was a Black man til he died. They could easily get a light African American male with his same features to play him.”  Michael is no longer with us and can no longer speak for himself, but we do know Michael wasn’t here for a white child playing him. While we’ll never know MJ’s thoughts on this for sure, the idea to have Michael played by a white actor and the lack of diversity in Oscar nominations highlight that representation is a major issue in the entertainment industry. The lack of diversity is not the sickness, it is a symptom of a larger failing industry. It is important to be able to turn on the TV or go to a movie theater and see people who look like you performing at a prominent level. However, the kinds of roles available to actors of color is just as import as seeing them represented. I’m tired of watching “Oscar worthy” movies with Black actors in subservient positions. Black writers and directors should not be the only ones able to create powerful and dynamic roles for Black actors. It is not an impossible task. If Shonda Rhimes can create a character who is African American, over the age of 30, successful, well-respected, and complicated, so can the rest of Hollywood. I want future generations to be able to turn on the TV and not see whiteness as the default of American narratives. So until Hollywood can figure it out, I am just going to sit here and look at this amazing gif of Blue Ivy Carter slaying us all with her beautiful “baby hair and afro.”  &nbsp;        by Kodi Alvord  I am a Yale student. This means that every morning I wake up, brush my teeth, take a hot shower, and fill my water bottle in the dining hall before I attend class. For me, this is my routine. For residents of Flint, Michigan, this is a luxury. In the past few weeks, Flint’s catastrophic water crisis has made national headlines, invoking a furious search for someone to blame. Elevated levels of lead in the drinking water are predicted to have lasting impacts on the neurological development of Flint’s children. These children may live the rest of their lives in the shadow of this crisis. The disaster has also been linked to an outbreak of Legionnaire’s disease. For many people, including filmmaker Michael Moore, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and MSNBC reporter Rachel Maddow, Michigan’s governor, Rick Snyder, is to blame. But is this really true? Is Rick Snyder ultimately responsible for this disaster? An assessment of government documents, including Rick Snyder’s emails, suggests that it is. The Snyder administration was warned repeatedly that lead levels in drinking water rose after the government decided to begin using the Flint River as a water source. Snyder’s administration responded by disparaging individuals who warned of the disaster. Furthermore, Rick Snyder had personal oversight of the emergency managers who signed the initial order to begin using the river as a source of drinking water and who later sold the original pipeline that had supplied Flint citizens with water from Detroit. In doing so, the Michigan government committed Flint to drinking from its own river until a separate water pipeline could be established. While the general public outcry has been aimed directly at Gov. Snyder, significantly less attention has been paid to the state of Michigan’s political atmosphere, and how it enabled this disaster. For instance, Rachel Maddow calls the legislation that allows Snyder to override elections and appoint his own emergency managers, “the single most radical piece of legislation put into law by any state in the country in our modern political history.” In order to understand the Flint situation, we must acknowledge that political negligence, discrimination, and stereotyping are all public health issues, and citizens bear the responsibility of constructing favorable political climates that protect them. We must also note that the situation in Flint is not without precedent. In 1900, the five largest cities in America all used lead pipes with severe consequences. In that year, lead pipes increased infant mortality and still birth rates between 25 and 50% in the average Massachusetts town. In Lowell, Massachusetts, the effects were even more salient. Lead service pipes were used to connect water mains to local households, and in the next 18 months, lead poisoning developed in 8 families, with 18 documented cases of lead poisoning, one death, and severe impacts on mental health. Subsequent tests revealed that lead levels existed well above government regulations. I attended high school at Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School in Bloomfield Hills. The school is a short drive from Flint, and I frequently passed through Flint on my way to other destinations. Students often spoke of how they’d roll the windows up at stoplights, and would never go there at night. When people mentioned Flint, the effect was a normalization of violence and conflation of criminal and non-criminal identity. Consequently, I never heard any student support political activity involving Flint. It wasn’t worth their time. The problem is not that Flint has been branded America’s most violent city. It is that this label allows outsiders to smear Flint residents with harmful stereotypes. The social stigma against Flint, coupled with widespread political unconsciousness, has helped construct the sociopolitical atmosphere that precedes disaster. In 2012, Cranbrook held a mock presidential election. While the majority of students voted for Mitt Romney, nearly everyone disfavored numerous policies that Romney supported in his campaign. Notably, most students believed that the Keystone XL pipeline was an environmentally damaging project, and should be abandoned. These same students pushed for a Romney administration. Cranbrook students are not legally adults, but they are members of Michigan’s most prestigious high school, and supposedly educationally elite. The Cranbrook election results suggest that voters in Michigan may not be as politically aware as they think they are. In failing to vote in accordance with their principles, and blindly following sociopolitical norms, voters create a government that does not work for them. But even worse is the fact that many potential voters in recent years have not made it to the polls at all. General sentiment that the political process is beyond saving, coupled with systemic barriers to political participation that disproportionately affect low income communities of color (such as Voter ID laws), have discouraged citizens from taking control of their political environment. When Rick Snyder was re-elected governor, his favorability ratings were abysmally low.  Voter turnout in Michigan was 42.8%, and Snyder won only 6.82% of Detroit votes. So who is to blame? If we’re going to pin the crisis on Rick Snyder, we need to examine the social and political antecedents to the Flint Water Crisis. We must recognize that the nation’s infrastructure is crumbling, and Flint does not stand alone in its suffering. In fact, a 2003 study by the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) found that “few cities are in outright violation of national contamination standards for drinking water, but this is more the result of weak standards than it is of low contamination levels. It is time for all of us to demand accountability in politics. It is time to declare loudly, “We are Flint.” It is time for Flint to take back their government, for outsiders in Michigan to wake up and participate in the process, for a revitalization of health-oriented political consciousness in America. There is one presidential candidate calling for such a revolution: Bernie Sanders. The political establishment in Flint stole the health and well-being of a generation. In the name of public health, it is time to Bern down that establishment.        by Ashia Ajani  Right before the deadline to submit documents for the Baltimore mayoral race, Black Lives Matter activist and self-described “child of Baltimore” DeRay Mckesson entered his information and joined the fray. DeRay is a Bowdoin College graduate who taught sixth grade math at Minneapolis Public Schools until quitting his job March of last year to become a full time activist. Now, he is running for mayor. DeRay’s presence brings the possibility of a serious critique of the justice system, racial profiling and other severe issues looming over the Black community. However, within Baltimore, he has some serious reaching out to do. Although he is a Baltimore native, many claim he’s out of touch with grassroots projects within the local Black community. Some question whether his activist background will translate well to public office. Others believe his candidacy will divide and confuse the Black community. Jill Carter, a member of Maryland’s House of Delegates, went so far as to call DeRay’s bid “ridiculous.” Personally, I think the positives outweighs the potential drawbacks. What will it say for the future of the country if Baltimore goes from having a Black woman mayor—a woman vocal and unapologetic in her criticism of the Baltimore Police Department—to electing a Black gay man? It could shape America’s idea of who can be elected to public office. How might DeRay’s candidacy revitalize a Baltimore Black community that is sick and tired of under-funded school districts, violence, and food deserts? How could it inspire other low-income, divided cities across America? A strange sort of hope and faith run through my veins. It is still way too early in the game to start planning DeRay’s political career. Yet in a city that is still tending to the fresh wounds of the Freddie Gray murder and police brutality—a city that needs the promise of a better future—DeRay Mckesson could be the necessary change.        by Daad Sharfi  I had never been surrounded by so many Muslim writers before. I walked into a lecture hall tucked away in the City College of New York School of Law to attend the Muslim Writers Collective’s first open mic of the yearThe Storyteller’s Resolution. I was not prepared for the three hours of poetic resistance and rhythmic confessions I was about to witness.   The Muslim Writers Collective (MWC) is an initiative launched in 2014 as a platform where writers, aspiring artists and young professionals can share their stories. It aims to reinvigorate a rich literary tradition amongst Muslim Americans through spoken word, short stories, monologues, rap and song. With Islamophobic rhetoric rising to an unprecedented level, it is important to reclaim our narratives as Muslim Americans now more than ever. MWC chapters have spread across the country, with additional chapters in San Francisco, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington DC.  After settling down with a plate loaded with complementary samosas and kofta, I was pierced by the sharp reality of the context we live in. Two representatives from the CUNY CLEAR project (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility)opened up the show by encouraging all audience members who have or will ever face transgressions on their rights by national security and counterterrorism policies and practices to reach out to the legal services available through this program. Injustice and the presumption of criminality have become such an imminent threat, an inescapable reality lurking in the shadows of being Muslim in America. Our gatherings had to be prefaced with how to handle that. Here we were, over a hundred Muslims in a single roomstruggling students, recent graduates, physicians and filmmakers. Our distinct narratives all crossed paths at one common intersection: being Muslim in America. Or in other words, surviving America as a Muslim. In that moment, nothing felt more urgent than the promise of controlling the recountal of my story, during a historical moment inundated with presumptions of who I am as Muslim, as woman, as American. And as the space that exists in between.  Last semester, amidst the turmoil caused by Donald Trump’s call to ban Muslims from entering the country and the frightening surge in hate crimes committed against Muslims in North America and Europe following the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, I felt stuck in a story with a terrible plot. I wake up. A woman at San Diego State University is choked with her hijab by a white man in his twenties. Grab brunch. Large rocks are repeatedly smashed through the windows of a Muslim family’s home in Texas. Go to discussion section. Sixteen year old Somali-born Hamza Warsame is severely beaten and thrown off a sixth-story window in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Cram for a seminar. Kids rip a fellow sixth-grader’s hijab off her head after taunting her with ISIS jokes. Eat dinner. Hot coffee is poured over two Muslim men praying in the corner of a public park in Sacramento. Pray. A Muslimah is pushed into the path of an oncoming London Underground train. I start to lose track.  Sitting in that lecture room whose walls, like my own, were graciously being confided in by ten first-time performersI wondered if ten, fifteen or hundreds of shared stories could even begin to cure this deep-seeded sickness of the heart. The kind that spreads like a deadly virus through a national consciousness yet leaves many people harmed, dehumanized and dead in secret. Is anyone listening? That night in New York, I listen. I soak in the final lines of a rap performed by Sherif Ibrahim: we above it / we will rise / with art and love / we’ll change the tides. I think about the stories I had heard so far that nighton depression and the diaspora. On surveillance and patience. On practicing love and accountability in the face of discrimination. It must means something, to trust a halfheartedly listening world with your story and most importantly, to believe in the possibility of reframing the narrative surrounding you.  Maybe the storyteller’s resolution is just that: to express unapologetically. I do not know if anyone is listening, but this year I commit to write. I will not write to convince the likes of Trump of my humanity because I know who I am. I will write for myself, for my Muslim brothers and sisters. I will write for anyone willing to listen with an open soul and for those who choose the art of storytellingwhatever form it may taketo resist bigotry. If a revolution begins with a person on fire running towards fire, then I will ignite a flame with my words.         by Madison DeJesus  With 44 seconds left on the clock, Peyton Manning, then an Indianapolis Colt, throws an incomplete pass under pressure to Reggie Wayne and guarantees a New Orleans Saints victory in Super Bowl XLIV. With 40 seconds left on the clock Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne are seen leaving the field before the accustomed congratulations to the winning team. When questioned about how they could show such unsportsmanlike conduct, Manning crafted the excuse that it was “the time for the Saints to celebrate. Its their field. They deserve the moment.” In response, there were numerous reports of support for Manning’s love of the game and the innate competitiveness of being a quarterback in the Super Bowl. To understand the importance of this moment we first must understand the journey that led the 16-1 Caroline Panthers to the Super Bowl. Cam Newton was drafted to the Panthers in the 2011 NFL Draft as the first overall pick. He threw for over 400 yards in his first game, shattering Peyton Manning’s first game record by over 120 yards. But what sets Newton aside from other leading quarterbacks is not his pass percentage but his ability to run the ball as well. He became the first quarterback to ever have 300 yards passing and over 100 yards rushing in the same game. Newton was inherently changing the game, requiring a higher standard of skill and athleticism than a quarterback is usually responsible for. For most of the 2015-2016 season the Panthers were undefeated, losing their first game in late December to the Atlanta Falcons. For the Panthers, this has been the most exciting season in franchise history, but it has also been the most controversial. The biggest controversy of the regular season was Newton’s famous touchdown dance. The touchdown dance is critical to a player’s personality on the field and to the excitement of the game. Almost every top running back and quarterback has a signature touchdown dance. When Victor Cruz dances Salsa in the end zone, the whole crowd goes wild; it’s what he is known for. But for Newton the response is different. Cam, being the young Black man that he is, is hip to the pop culture dance trends of our generation and does dances including the Nae Nae, the stanky leg and his now infamous Dab. Black quarterbacks are hard to find (although their presence in the game has been steadily increasing) and yet here is a Black quarterback shattering records and celebrating it in a way millennials can understand. He is relatable. But most importantly, he is a relatable inspiration to Black youth. His celebratory end zone dance has been highly criticized in the media, most famously by a white mother who wrote a letter to Cam claiming she did not want her daughter watching Newton’s “obnoxious” and “crude” behavior. That might be fair if famous players like Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Rob Gronkowski were held to the same standard and were subject to the similar remarks. But the reality is that they’re not held to the same standard. Aaron Rodgers’ move in the end zone was so popular that State Farm ran advertisements focusing on it. The touchdown dance has been widely accepted as part of the game – except when Cam Newton does it. I can only infer from these comparisons that what separates Cam Newton from his fellow quarterbacks who dance in the end zone is the color of his skin. Racial politics played a large role in Newton’s journey to the Super Bowl, and that is why it is not a surprise they manifested themselves in the most heart breaking loss of his career. Newton couldn’t win in peace and now he cannot lose in peace. Despite the media narrative labeling Newton an immature sore loser, he showed grace throughout the game. In his attempt to rally his team for a comeback drive, Newton received pressure from the Denver defense ultimately ending in a thrown away pass and a hard tackle to the ground by number 95. Newton screamed and waved his whole body around looking for a roughing the passer flag. He did not get one. And in one of the most under reported moments of the game, he got up, put his two hands on the sides of his helmet, closed his eyes and breathed. He returned back to his O-line calm and collected and proceeded to lose the game in graceful fashion. An impulsive, hotheaded quarterback could have easily been ejected from the game in that moment. Cam could have gotten up, yelled at the ref and gotten himself into trouble. Instead he took a simple, deep breath and got back in the game. That is a great quarterback and that is a great loser. When the Panthers lost the game 24-10 and with 0 seconds left on the clock, Newton was seen congratulating Peyton Manning on his 200th win (and probably the last win of his career) with a smile. This is a much different reaction than Manning had himself when his team lost the Super Bowl just seven seasons ago. But why is nobody talking about that moment? Simple answer: Newton left the post game press conference abruptly after supposedly overhearing comments about his inability to pass the ball from another interviewee. Instead of being met with the same understanding and sympathy that Manning was met when he left the field (a much more unsportsmanlike action) Newton was met with racially charged criticisms. The most controversial tweet came from Bill Romanowski, former NFL linebacker, and the tweet read: “You will never last a minute in the NFL with that attitude, the world doesn’t revolve around you, boy!” The use of the term “boy” is highly racialized given the American historical context and the lack of its use in referring to white players. Newton responded with poise and grace saying: “I’ve said this since Day One, I’m an African American quarterback that scares people because they haven’t seen nothing that they can compare me to,” and he could not be more right. Newton continues to be an inspiration, playing his heart out every game and raising the bar for quarterbacks across the league while maintaining his humor and personality. Cam Newton is one of the greatest men to play the game – and he has only just begun. The NFL and football fans everywhere better get ready, because he is Black and proud and that is the most dangerous thing for the racist ideology currently governing the game.        by Arturo Pineda On February 16th, President Peter Salovey and Provost Benjamin Polak announced the establishment of a Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration (RITM). The new center will continue the work of the Ethnicity, Race, ; Migration Program by focusing on the intersectionality of race, gender, and sexuality but aim to further the research of Native and diasporic communities across the world. This announcement is the realization of Salovey’s November 17th promise of such a center in his response email to demands from students and pressure from faculty. Professor Pitti will serve as the inaugural director of the center and chair the center’s implementation committee. Other universities have similar centers for the study of specific “ethnic and racialized populations,” Pitti said, but Yale’s center is distinctly organized to take on the many intersections across groups. “Many of them don’t have a concern about gender or sexuality written into their primary mission and most of them are quite national in their focus, which is to say they are almost exclusively the United States,” he wrote in an email. “I think we have an opportunity to do something very different.” Through not a direct acquiescence to Next Yale’s demand for the establishment of an ethnic studies department, many are optimistic for the potential influence the center could have, as a point of reference on Yales campus is the well funded Whitney Humanities Center. The committee will be comprised of a team of professors across departments including American Studies, Sociology, African American Studies, and Women’s, Gender ; Sexuality Studies. Professor Hazel Carby, a member of the implementation committee, also emphasized the importance of student activism in this achievement. “We have been making the argument for a center like this for many, many years,” she said. “This center is evidence of the power of the students…it wasn’t until the student protests that our claims were taken seriously.” She said she hopes the administration will supply the center with a firm endowment and commitment to it’s success, as Brown University did to demonstrate the university’s acknowledgement and respect for these historically devalued fields. The center will begin its major programming in the Fall of 2016. The implementation committee is comprised of: Elijah Anderson (Professor of Sociology), Ned Blackhawk (Professor of American Studies and History), David Blight (Professor of American History and Director of Gilder Lehrman Center at Yale), Hazel Carby (Charles C. and Dorathea S. Dilley Professor of African American Studies, African Studies, and Director of the Initiative on Race Gender and Globalization), Inderpal Grewal (Professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; of American Studies; and of Anthropology), Mary Lui (Professor of American Studies, History, and Women’s Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and Master of Timothy Dwight College), and Jock Reynolds (Director of the Yale University Art Gallery).        DOWN Voices Staff Because the social media accounts of Yalies of color give us life. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;         by Karen Marks  January 24th began recruitment for Yale’s four sororities: Kappa Kappa Gamma (Kappa), Kappa Alpha Theta (Theta), Pi Beta Phi (Pi Phi), and the newest chapter of Alpha Phi. On entering the rush process, sophomore Theta pledge Celeste Dushime said that she knew for sure that she would be in a minority of rushes, “but it was easier to go into rushing accepting it.” Having set herself up to avoid the shock of under-representation, Dushime actually felt that there were more rushes of color than she had anticipated. Teniola Lanre-Amos, a new freshman Pi Phi pledge, entered the rush process with a sense of optimism. Interested in Greek life from the very beginning, Lanre-Amos asked about the Black sorority experience at a pre-orientation Cultural Connections panel where she found the answers from panelists “overwhelmingly positive.” The message of purpose also appealed to her, and she was impressed by the possibilities of sororities being a space to be heard and of dismantling the white culture that seemed to be a part of Greek life. Dismantling white culture does not only mean explicit conversations about race, but also finer points such as socioeconomic standing and organizational requirements. Dushime noted Theta’s offer of financial aid and willingness to speak about dues during the start of the rush process. Most sorority dues hover around six hundred dollars the semester a student joins, and then about three hundred and fifty dollars for each following semester of membership. Dushime felt that dues were something that could keep particularly students of color from rushing and was not only impressed with Theta’s financial aid plan but also “the fact that they realized it was something important to be talked about in the beginning,” which was a contributing factor in her ranking of sororities during the rush process. Dushime was also glad that sororities seemed interested in doing better for their sisters of color, especially in light of last semester’s events. She was happy with the genuine awareness of race because if a similar situation happened again during her membership, she wouldn’t want sisters who were not understanding or made her feel alone. An anonymous pledge noted that during her rush process, “Often, [women of color] were given a platform to talk and to share how their sisters really supported them during that time, which yes, sometimes seemed like a token statement, but it was also great seeing these women with a voice in the group and did seem genuine.” She noted that she was at first alarmed on bid night by “how blonde” her sorority was, but eventually relaxed and enjoyed the company of her new sisters. While she appreciates her upperclassmen sisters of color, the pledge accepts that the rest of her life “will probably be navigating mainly white spaces,” so she’s ready for the challenge. Another anonymous pledge noted that most of the issues with race seemed to come from mostly external sources. An anonymous post on GreekRank.com, a platform for ranking sororities at various colleges and universities, ranks Theta as a bottom tier sorority and says “…Alpha Phi had the best pledge class. Hot blondes. New top tier? Move aside Theta and Pi Phi. Kappa’s not worth mentioning.” The pledge noted that the disregard for sororities’ philanthropy and values of sisterhood was often perpetuated by external judgment by the male gaze, and ranking sisters based on the Western standard of beauty. She also noted that this vapid image also contributed to friends of color judging her for joining a seemingly white-dominated space. However, in the end, pledges of color felt sororities were a place where they could feel relaxed and understood. Dushime noted that her previous friendships were often built on account of her Blackness, her African background, her queer identity, or her extracurricular activities. She considered joining Fence Club (a co-ed, non-Greek social club with many members of color and on the LGBTQ+ spectrum) but decided that it would be yet another social group built on identity. In Theta, she said, “I’m just me.”        by Laura Plata  Wandering around campus in a slightly too large parka during Bulldog days, I remember entering La Casa and feeling slightly bashful from the overwhelming response I received from the students there. The joy on their faces to hear that I was an admitted student was only slightly less than their excitement to hear I was Latina, and I wanted to be a part of their vibrant community.  The events that took place from the end of October through November served as a jarring reminder that perhaps the vision I had of Yale was not a reality for everyone or at the very least, that it wasn’t being fulfilled. The solidarity around issues concerning inclusion, diversity, and marginalization in the following weeks reinforced my belief that students of color at Yale were fearless and powerful beyond my original understanding.  But as the stories of trauma and mental exhaustion came forth, I also understood that there was a difference between having my “strong community of color where I could feel like I belonged” and belonging to the campus as a whole.  I came to understand that voices have been crying, “We out here; We’ve been here; We ain’t leaving; We are loved,” for years on my behalf, before I had even showed up on campus. The sophomores, juniors, and seniors of color on this campus had been fighting against institutional racism their entire time here, and they were exhausted. I had only been on campus for two months. When the question, “How are you doing?” was inevitably asked, I was always less and less certain of my answer because I saw the future me; I would be just as weary as them. Upperclassmen lamented that I was robbed of experiencing my freshman year to the fullest. I was certainly not simply focused on my classes, making new friends, and interacting normally with the campus. To think that without the visible eruption of pain and frustration around me I would stayed a naive, complacent freshman is to dismiss the reality that  I never had the privilege of being naive in the first place. I  just would have gone through that experience on my own, alone.  I am grateful that November happened the way it did. Without it, I perhaps would have let the racial tensions on this campus wear me down like water dripping over the edge of a sink so that when you peer underneath you find that the wood has been worn away.  Because of November, I know with undeniable certainty that there are layers and layers of people around me who care about my wellbeing and would go out of their way to ensure I am okay. I came to feel the love and community of my peers who more than willingly engaged in thoughtful conversation about race and inclusion. And I came to know that, yes, this campus belonged to me too.         by Ryan Wilson  Like millions of other kids since the early 20th century, I grew up on superhero cartoons and comics. These stories made up of bright, fantastic colors both on the screen and on the page, made up some of the most enjoyable moments of my childhood. For me and many other kids, the adventures of costumed heroes imparted in us a sense of “truth, justice, and the American way.” As a Black child, I often found myself misrepresented, nonexistent, or always a supporting cast member. In worlds full of aliens, magic, and mutants, time and time again it was implied that the narrative of people who looked like me was not important. As highlighted by the “Black Pulp!” art exhibit at the Yale School of Arts Edgewood Avenue Gallery, struggles surrounding the recognition and representation of Black narratives are not new. The journals, novels, dustjackets, cartoons, comics, and contemporary art pieces on display illustrate the historical and ongoing debates surrounding Black personhood and the problems that have encompassed Black identity. The historical works cover a variety of still important topics ranging from segregation, to racial stereotypes, to police brutality. Within this sampling of generations of Black popular imagination are the too often overlooked perspectives of Black Americans regarding not only topics centered on Blackness, but also issues like war, or everyday issues of family and romance. Alongside Black pacifist journals calling for the ends of WWII and the Vietnam War, there are comics drawn by cartoon artist Jackie Ormes. Defying the cultural and drawn stereotypes surrounding Black women in the 1950s, Ormes created a relatively long running comic about an independent, successful, modern Black woman in a time when female writers and illustrators struggled to gain success. Other works in the collection include early comics of Black superheroes such as Black Panther, Luke Cage, and my childhood favorite, Static Shock. One of the most important aspects of this exhibit is that it showcases art that returns agency over Black bodies and stories to Black characters. Too often the Black experience is having to hear yourself be discussed without being included in the conversation. These exclusions can happen for a variety of reasons, from being intentionally kept out to never being told or shown that joining is a possibility. The works in “Black Pulp!” not only include Black voices and characters, but centralizes them in their own narratives. We are living in a time when American cities are constantly having anti-police brutality protests, primarily Black communities live in areas with undrinkable water, and students of color across the country are demanding inclusion in curriculums and representation in administration and faculty. It is apparent now that the inclusion of the perspectives of Black people is vital in creating a more just and equitable society. Engaging with the multitude of art forms present at the “Black Pulp!” exhibit plays an important role in acknowledging Black voices and contributions to popular culture and American thought. To ignore these voices is to ignore the humanity of the artists and the subjects that the artists have sought to represent. Popular culture and societal values shape one another. “Black Pulp!” combats and refutes the degradation and ignorance of Black bodies in popular fiction so as to combat the destruction of Black bodies in real life. The exhibit embodies the spirit of the protests at Yale and across the country. It is a call for a change to traditional white-centric narratives and representation. It is the demand for the right to tell our own stories under the threat of nonexistence. The sentiment of the exhibit is best captured by Audre Lorde’s words when she said “If I didnt define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other peoples fantasies for me and eaten alive.” The Black Pulp! Exhibit was curated by artists William Villalongo and Mark Thomas Gibson. It will be up in the Edgewood Gallery until March 11th.        by Daad Sharfi  Vi Takahashi was a young Seattle teenager in 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, ordering all Japanese-Americans to vacate the West Coast. It was two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The order displaced 120,000 people. While Takahashi herself was never interned, her husband spent two years in the Manzanar concentration camp in California, and her father—arrested the night of the Pearl Harbor attacks—was imprisoned in Ft. Missoula, Montana. She vividly recalled her own anxiety and fear through an illustrated talk entitled “Loyal Citizens, Prisoners of War.” The talk was part of a week-long series of Remembrance Day events highlighting narratives of internment. Using a combination of oral history, graphic images, and hand-drawn sketches of the camp structure, Takahashi brought to life a tragic period in American history in which an entire group of people was classified as the “enemy” and treated as such. Takahashi emphasized the inhumane conditions of Japanese internment camps from the outset of her presentation. The Manzanar camp’s 500-acre housing section was surrounded by barbed wires, guard towers with searchlights, and a patrol of military police. Eight individuals would share a 20-by-25 foot room furnished only with a light bulb and some cots. These were concentration camps. FDR’s Executive Order 9066 described Japanese Americans as threats to national security, igniting xenophobia against people of Asian descent and reinforcing an imagination of the American citizen built upon whiteness. Reflecting on the alienation she felt in her family’s neighborhood of 25 years, Takahashi poignantly noted that while it takes years to build trust, “It only takes suspicion and not proof to destroy it.”  The forced relocation of men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry—70% of whom were American citizens—to ten remote internment camps across the country disrupted traditional family life and inflicted severe psychological trauma. It also incurred approximately $1.5 billion and $2.7 billion in property and income loss, respectively. As one of only a few remaining internment survivors, Takahashi was wary of present and future incarnations of similar state-sanctioned prejudice. Using the examples of a Burqa-clad woman and bearded Brown man, she compelled her audience to contemplate the kinds of associations we attach to people who look “different.” Using ethnic background to question people’s rights and loyalties is neither a new phenomenon, nor one that will escape us anytime soon.        by Jorge Lema  “I feel that smart kids are dedicated to school and do not have the same personality as me,” my sister Stefany told me. For years, my parents and I questioned why Stefany chose to attend the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology (Tele, a zone school) while I attended a prestigious magnet school. We wondered why she refused to take the New York City Specialized High School entrance exam (SHSAT). Without it, she would not be able to attend a school like mine. There are nine specialized high schools in New York City. Students need to score high enough on an exam to gain admission. I barely passed the SHSAT to attend Brooklyn Technical High School, a prestigious magnet school. The student body was 60% Asian American, 20% white, 8% Black, and 8% Hispanic. At that point, I had been the only Latinx in the advanced placement class in middle school. I regarded this 8% as a blessing. It was an opportunity to bond with individuals who were not only like me in terms of their academic ambition, but who also looked like me. My sister viewed this 8% with horror. The 56% Latinx population at Tele was much more attractive. For Stefany, attending Brooklyn Tech, or any specialized high school, required a trade-off: giving up her identity as a Latina to study at a school where she found it difficult to connect with students who “spoke smart” and did not understand her culture. In addition, she didn’t believe she could even make it into Brooklyn Tech. To her, intelligence is measured by how much you read, how informed you are about politics, or by the way you spoke. These were qualities that she never identified with or defined herself by. Now, at Tele, Stefany’s friends marvel at how privileged she is. We have a house, three cars, two parents, a dog, beds to sleep on, and a space where a family of four can live comfortably. Many of her friends have family members in jail, are adopted or in foster care, have never met their biological parents, or share a two-bedroom studio apartment with their family of six. At her school, the privilege of living in a home where mom and dad are still together belongs to the elite. The pinnacle of this privilege, in their eyes, is that Stefany has a brother who goes to Yale. My sister is looked down upon for choosing to attend a school which is predominately Latino. This school is underfunded, hires teachers who expect failure from certain students, and does not produce academically successful student machines the way that Brooklyn Tech does. I’m not sure the fact that she would feel uncomfortable at a school like Brooklyn Tech justifies her choice. Stefany’s decision to surround herself with people who are like her may have had a detrimental effect on her future. I know she will be successful, but that does not hide the fact that she might have to work twice as hard as I did to find resources that will aid her on her journey to a place like Yale. Her friends question why she chose to attend school with them. They wonder how a Yalie could have a sister at Tele. I find myself asking the same thing. Yalies are not low income, first generation, Latino American, from Sunset Park, or Tele students with family members in jail. In their eyes, Yalies fit a different mold. Yes, my family lives in a home – but in the basement of that home. Yes, we have three cars – but they are a taxi, a van, and a 16ft truck – essential to the labor work that my father does in the city. I also have two parents and, for that, I am blessed. I would be nowhere without them. I would be nowhere without the resources that Brooklyn Tech provided. I would not be at Yale without the internship through the Alumni office, the guidance counselor who became my friend, teachers who pushed me to get involved in extracurricular activities, and faculty who advised me on the college process. My sister won’t get that at Tele. I would have never made it to Yale had I not conformed to the system. My minority status in all of my classes since the sixth grade eased the transition into Brooklyn Tech. It also diminished the desire to choose a school based on a demographic with which I identified. I took AP classes and I often represented Latinos through my performance. I dealt with the “dirty Mexican” or “does your father mow a lawn for a living?” jokes as I assimilated into Brooklyn Tech culture as well as the New York City education system. This is a system that discriminates against people of color and only advances students that accept an exam as the sole determinant of their value. It’s a system that works for students of color only if they show potential for success, without providing help them or guidance. This is a system that says I am good enough, but my sister is not. An institutional divide exists within my home. Stefany is questioned for wasting an opportunity to study in one of New York City’s best high schools. Our ideologies paved these contrasting roads. I chose to go through the system. I just wanted to succeed – for mom and dad. Stefany, however, chose not to play the game. Her identity overpowered her desire for conventional success. I am now at Yale. My sister isn’t and I worry about how she’ll get here. I want to push her to conform to the system, so that we both gain access to resources that otherwise won’t be available. But I want her to be true to herself. I hope universities don’t dismiss her application because of where she studies or how she took advantage of resources “available” at her school. Stefany, I promise to serve as a mentor. One that looks like you and lives with you. My privilege as a Yale student will aid you on your road to success.        by Ashia Ajani  During lunch, where some of the most uncomfortable conversations take place, one of my peers brought up the death of Justice Scalia, who in my opinion, need not be spoken of anymore than necessary.  Despite Scalia’s bigotry, his history of habitually flunking Black students under his instruction when he was a law professor, anti-reproductive rights views and a whole slew of other no-nos, the only thing this person could say was “well, on reading some of the articles about his death, he seemed like a genuinely friendly, charismatic human being.” As a Black queer woman, it has become increasingly harder to thrive in an environment that is so hell-bent on excusing the actions of racists and “politically incorrect” people. I eat lunch with them. I go to class with them. I see them on the streets, on the news and on social media.  This is not a new phenomenon: In 2013, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote about “The Good, Racist People,” those who do not embody our modern concept of racists: blatant, monstrous beings who take pleasure in the subjugation of others, but fall under the category of “well meaning” people who just make mistakes, vote liberal and heartily believe that we live in a post-racial society.  On a large scale, people of all backgrounds are willing to eat it up; I call this “Nice Racist Syndrome.” Nice Racist Syndrome is what allows Quentin Tarantino to consistently use the same Black actors in his movies, while simultaneously filling up the lines of non-Black actors with the n-word for shock value, and still get praised for his work.  It is what protects Taylor Swift from judgement while degrading Amber Rose in one fell swoop. It is in all of our mouths whenever we qualify a person’s faults with all of their redeeming qualities: “well, they are really nice,” “he paid for coffee once,” “she has a great sense of humor,” “they just made a mistake.”  “Nice Racists” are able to free their tongues punition, and, due to their charisma, still remain in good social standing.  A friend asked me where I draw the line; where I am able to forgive racist individuals and move past their faults. When confronted with this, I thought about the occurrences of the “nice racist apology.” The apologies of “Nice Racists” can be quite compelling.  As demonstrated by Paula Deen, all you really have to do is say sorry, assert that you are not racist, that you work with or talk to or know one Black person, and you’re golden. It is gotten to the point where I can never really tell if the apology is sincere or not.  Generally, the format of a well thought out apology starts with “I’m sorry”, follows up with an admittance of responsibility, leads into “I understand what I did was wrong because A, B and C” and closes with “this is how I will conduct myself better in the future.” From all of the apologies I’ve seen and been compelled to endure personally, none of these follow this format, and I’m less than willing to consider them genuine. Putting faith in “Nice Racists” starts to become a drag after a while, because usually, there is always a follow up. Through enough of these encounters, I’ve finally learned how to respond with; “I forgive you,” instead of “It’s alright.”My mother constantly gets on me for surrounding myself with like-minded people and never branching out to meet people with opposing views. Most of my friends are liberal, most of them are women of color, and a good number of them are queer.  I purposefully built a support system that would allow me to express myself freely without constant repudiation. In my opinion, as long as their views do not have the potential to do me (black, queer, neurodivergent) serious harm, I welcome their company. We can bond together over all of the “nice racists” we’ve encountered in our lifetimes. On the flipside, outside of my friend group, my views are challenged every day. I wake up ready to head into battle. I put on my sad queer girl smile and brave the world in all its nice racist glory. I myself am trying to remain strong in my ideology and not give in to the “Nice Racist Syndrome.” I have said problematic things in the past, and will probably continue to say such things (either by accident or out of ignorance), and I expect to be corrected as such. I know that there are people out there who care enough, or at least are tired of suppressing their feelings, to call out problematic behavior and address the faults of another.  This timeline of give and receive, unfortunately, can only help those who are open to it. The other day, a white man told me that it wasn’t fair to compare past histories to present action (or lack thereof). I suppose goodness has a timeline, too.         by Eleanor Pritchett  We write music/ we write songs/ to tell a story,” Lin-Manuel Miranda rapped in his Grammy acceptance last week, standing on the stage of Broadway’s Richard Rodgers Theater.  Pushing to the front, Anthony Ramos waved Puerto Rico’s flag, frantic and proud; behind him was the whole cast of Hamilton, the breakout rap musical Miranda wrote, directed, and now won a Grammy for. Hamilton is the story of “America then, told by America now.” It’s told by “America now” not only in the deliberately POC casting, but in the very story itself.  Lin doesn’t just play a Hamilton who happens to look Puerto Rican, he creates a journey that includes the reclamation of an immigrant identity, sacrifice, sisterhood, friendship, debates against slavery, and a fight against tyranny that can’t help but speak to POC of today.   It’s a show about people of color, by people of color—for people of color, but  in true Broadway fashion,  everyone who has seen this show is white. “Do you know any people of color who’ve seen Hamilton?” Long pause. “Yeah, me neither.”   Repeat a dozen times. From experience and from asking, I’ve found one person of color around me at Yale who has seen Hamilton.  That begs a thousand questions.  Why are white people so into Hamilton?  Why don’t people of color see Hamilton?  Who is Hamilton’s audience?   For the 2014-2015 season, nearly 80% of tickets on Broadway were bought by white people; of the audience over 25, “78% had completed college and 39% had earned a graduate degree.”  Jury’s still out for the 15-16 season, but this is what Broadway is: patronized by educated white people. This just doesn’t jive with the visceral way the show affects people of color.  There is so much love for this show; it’s very moving, and it clearly moves its fans.  It makes you cry and love and root for the characters and cheer at cabinet battles and somehow get emotionally involved in the sentence, “You’re gonna need congressional approval and you don’t have the votes” (I promise this is riveting as a lyric).   There has been a huge artistic response to the show:  cover after cover after cover (after cover after cover), a ridiculous amount of art, and hundreds of people waiting in the cold for the $10 ticket lottery every day.  Whenever I say how much I love this show, it’s, “Oh, have you seen it?”  I always answer, “No, no one has.”  Not because it’s true—of course people have seen this show if it’s making [this much money]—but because oftentimes the people who love it most haven’t seen it.  For fans of the show, it’s an aspiration to be in the audience, but it’s essential to have loved it.  The fact of loving Hamilton is that the show is only marginally longer than the cast recording, which has been up on YouTube and Spotify since October.  There are very few unsung scenes, which makes it accessible and easy to love if you’ve given up the 2 hours and 22 minutes.  And fans of the show are often teenagers and young people, who don’t tend to have the resources to leave YouTube or Spotify due to the fact that the show has been sold out through 2016, and tickets tend to be on the secondary market for hundreds or thousands of dollars. This is the tension between the fanbase and the audience of the show. Hamilton tickets have been bought in bulk and sold on the secondary market while the fans waiting outside know all the words to the show to sing along during Ham4Ham singalongs.   Clearly these are true fans of the show who have a huge desire to be a part of the audience, but they are quite literally being left out in the cold.  You have to draw the line somewhere in order to make moneyand, for Lin Miranda, to create a phenomenon that pushes people of color to the front of the national consciousness through Broadway of all venues is an incredible, and very profitable feat. However, knowing that the voices on the cast recording are of color is not the same as seeing people who look like you playing the heroes of your grade school history lessons. Every day 21 front row tickets are offered in a lottery for $10 each, making the show an attainable dream for many dedicated Hamilton fans.  The lottery almost always comes with a #Ham4Ham show, where Lin and the cast joke and perform in front of the waiting masses.  (The lottery has recently moved online for the winter, if you’re inclined to try it from the safety of your dorm, and Lin posts daily Digital Ham4Ham videos.)   The cast and crew of this show are dohere for people of color. They’re waving PR flags at the Grammys.  They’re correcting nice racists, like the NPR reporters who say the show has a “minority cast.” “The casting is not ‘minority.’ Your piece is going to be dated in about five years when we’re the majority. So you might want to say ‘people of color,’” Lin practically spat.   They’re uploading the cast recording on YouTube right as the show goes on Broadway.  This year they’re instituting Wednesday matinees specially to bring in schoolchildren from New York and New Jersey.  As I’m writing this article, Lin is spending the day only tweeting in Spanish, not for any particular reason, and with no preamble but this:  It’s an attempt by the show to be part of the audience that’s mistreated by the medium at the same time as it exists as part of Broadway.  It’s odd and unfair and bizarre in that a 80% white, 80% educated group should be the in-person audience for the revolution that is Hamilton, but it’s fascinating and brilliant that the show allows those disenfranchised others to be its real fans.   In Lin’s words, “Im sorry theater only exists in one place at a time but that is also its magic.”  The revolution lies in the claim that people around the world with no way to be in that room have to an event that only exists on 46th Street. &nbsp;        by Elaine Lou  The first thing I noticed when I got off the plane was the ubiquitous English translation on every Chinese sign. Granted, that’s probably because I was still at Shanghai International Airport. But throughout my stay, I was repeatedly surprised at every English translation I didn’t expect on a menu or a signpost – because generally, I thought nobody was around to read it but me. Later, my aunt told me matter-of-factly that Chinese people put a premium on English speakers. They treat you differently if they hear your mouth produce the telltale, fluid monotone that is the English language. At one point, I even had people asking if my younger sister and I were half-white because we were loudly joking around in English– which, I’m disappointed to admit, made me feel guiltily pleased. The reason I tried not to speak my lopsided, broken Mandarin unless absolutely necessary went from wanting to downplay my ethnicity to wanting special treatment. Milking my American identity: this is how I began my two week adventure in China and Taiwan. I can’t remember when I decided that I hated being Chinese­. I do know that I was aware of the stereotypes early on, and they insidiously wound themselves into my self-perception at a very young age; so much so that I don’t ever recall a time when I felt like I was one hundred percent American, despite being born here and living here for the my entire life. If I look back I see the defining moments like frozen movie stills on a projector screen. Here’s ten-year-old me in the kitchen at home, asking my mom to not pack me dumplings for lunch again. Click. Here’s me again, age 16, fake-smiling at my teacher’s apologies after the seventh time he’s accidentally called me by another Asian girl’s name. Click. Here’s me, regardless of age, playing with my dolls or watching TV or browsing magazines and just wishing my hair was lighter, my eyes bigger, my nose taller, myself whiter. I thought I knew everything there was to know about China. I thought it was the land of rampant pollution, math nerds, emasculated men, and bubble tea, maybe. My ignorance, combined with my desire to put as much distance as possible between myself and my homeland, meant that it took a lot of convincing to get me on the fourteen-hour flight to visit. The only thing I knew about democratic, unpolluted Taiwan prior to visiting was that nobody is sure what to call it officially, for genuine fear of starting a brawl. I can recall snippets of my mom’s words about Taiwan’s political status from a conversation long ago, as she dismissed it like a parent dismissing rebellious teenage antics. To put it simply, Taiwan is a conversation no one wants to start. If Taiwan is a pair of tightly zipped lips, Hangzhou, China, is a half-formed sentence that everyone is racing to finish. It knows what it wants to be – a bustling, young, fashionable icon of modernity. For now, according to my cousin, it is a “developing minor metropolis,” marked by countless hard hats and jackhammers juxtaposed against glitzy supermalls filled with designer stores. This city, in all of its hopeful aspirations and obvious imperfections, strangely reminds me of myself. My cousin and I went to a deserted riverside. In Chinese cities, the skies are never blue and the smog is omnipresent; so that when the feeble afternoon sunlight hits the polluted air, it creates an ethereal glow around everything. I have a strange sense of near-sightedness as I look out over the Qiantang River. It’s like how you see things through a murky, soupy distortion in dreams. While surveying the unfamiliar city skyline across the water and listening to him tell me stories about the city pre-industrialization, I feel keenly aware of my American-ness for the first time in my life­. At that moment, I suddenly became a foreigner in a place where everyone looked just like me. I have this feeling as me and my family walk through the lonely, quiet backstreets of Taipei that lead to the little Airbnb we are staying in. The air is so swollen with moisture, even in the capital, that the skin on my hands has angrily broken out in rashes. I see many of the things I expected to see on this trip: a group of the elderly practicing tai chi in a tiny park sandwiched between two streets; rundown noodle shops next to bubble tea stands; terrible, terrible driving. What I don’t expect is a kind of fondness for the scenery, for the part of me that I had casually dismissed before as shabby and grimy and not good enough. Despite my efforts, I begin to accept the parts of myself that I found in the tapioca bubbles at the bottom of my drink, in the last spoonfuls of rich beef soup in my bowl of noodles. I am at ease as I sprint wildly up the dark, hilly streets of quiet mountain village Shifen, sausage-on-a-stick clenched in hand. My dad is yelling after me while I frantically make a beeline for the stray dogs that had captured my heart earlier. Strangers around me cheer as they take turns releasing their deepest desires, painted on huge, hot-air-fueled paper sky lanterns, into the dusky night. Squatting in the damp gravel, I feed greasy meat bit by bit to pungent, sweet-smelling black fur and glowing chocolate eyes that glitter with the colorful bright lights in the sky. A little while before, I’d sent up a pure white lantern of my own, hopes and dreams scrawled on with a brush and ink in French so that none of my nosy relative could read it. That was the last night I spent in Taiwan; as I laid in bed that evening, I thought about the blazing lanterns drifting away. I thought about Taiwan’s rain and Hangzhou’s haze, one’s charming authenticity and the other’s humming chaos. I wondered how there could be so many fundamental differences between Taiwan and China, yet somehow, they are contesting whether or not they could be part of the same thing. As I had that thought, it struck me that this is exactly what the Chinese and American parts of me are currently wrestling each other over – coexistence, and mutual acceptance as the two equally valuable halves of my identity.        by Nicole Chavez        by Joseph Zordan Yale. Just that single word evokes so many images, memories, and feelings. From Harkness, to SSS, to Comm… I mean Schwarzman, all the way to the coat brand that has become as ingrained in the average Yalie’s experiences, Canada Goose. Prior to Yale, I had never heard of the brand. This may have been because I come from one the most impoverished counties in Wisconsin, but I digress. Regardless, this blissful ignorance did not last long. Soon after arriving I discovered the brand from mostly the “Canada Moose” stickers sold by my residential college, Ezra Stiles. However, it was not until the temperature dipped under 40 did I begin to see what exactly Stiles meant when the ad stated that Canada Goose was, “brand that we all know and love (to hate).” Now as I write this, I don’t think a day has passed since I’ve seen at least twelve of our feathered friends. So ridiculously overrepresented are these luxury brand items on campus that the page “Canada Goose at Yale*,” recently hatched to accumulate 594 likes since it’s creation on January 21st. While platforms have surfaced to show people are, in the very least, comically aware of Yale’s Goose infestation; the question remains, however, why this infestation persists. The answer to this question could be a variety of things. There is, of course, the argument about product quality. I mean, what responsible parent wouldn’t want to send their kid out in some expedition gear here in the tundra of Connecticut? What other coat can I wear to enjoy a coyote fur lined hood? The answer is irrelevant because let’s be honest, this isn’t just about quality. They are good coats. Obviously the Canadian Federal Government wasn’t out there picking up whatever parka maker popped up in the late 50’s, but last time I checked we aren’t exactly quite that far north. Canada Goose’s presence on campus has caused whatever functional purpose the coats served originally, but have also become another symbol of Yale’s frivolous wealth. At the end of the day, there’s something about that ever-identifiable patch, fur-lined hood, and presence of “gaggles,” or large groups of people wearing Canada Goose, that really marks Canada Goose as just another ostentatious display of wealth here at Yale, no different from the monuments that define our landscape. *The author of this work is in no way affiliated with Canada Goose at Yale other than appreciation of it’s existence.        by Matt Thekkethala        by Eugene Lim  Looking up at Zwe Mon’s The Gaze (2013), it’s hard not to be struck by the strange proportions of its subject: a heavy-lidded woman stretched vertically across the canvas, glowering. She’s off-center; the viewer searches for balance, travelling up an elongated torso and returning to her face. But her eyes are downcast. She barely meets our gaze. The painting is emblematic of the rest of the exhibition, titled Altered State: Painting Myanmar in a Time of Transition. Curated and presented by Ian Holliday (Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor, University of Hong Kong) from the Thukhuma Collection, it features 35 paintings by 35 Myanmar artists. All were painted during the transition period of 2011, when a military-backed civilian government replaced oppressive rule by military junta, and the country once famous for its seclusion re-entered the world stage. None of the portraits look the viewer in the eyes, yet it’s impossible to resist their pensive expressions. They recall the tentative spark of recognition in someone viewing a long-forgotten face.  None of these paintings would have existed even a couple of years ago. Colors such as white, red, or black were discouraged, and political paintings like Aung Soe Min’s Crisis of Buddhism (2013) or Min Zaw’s Ordinary People (2012) would have been banned outright. Professor Holliday notes that this is why abstraction is missing from the collection; prolonged isolation and government suspicion of hidden messages have led Myanmar artists to avoid such techniques. Nevertheless, the exhibition resists exploiting the country’s history of political repression or dwelling on gloomy context. The paintings burst with color and life, portraying everything from the everyday scenes of Yangon Lives (Su Eaindra, 2015) to dramatic ceremonies in Novitiation Ceremony (Satt Aung, 2013). These works celebrate a vibrant, up-and-coming society with a rich history of anti-colonial struggle. Above all, there is a sense of movement. Phyu Hnin Lwin (SM ’18), who worked on the exhibition, hopes that the exhibition will “will trigger fresh thinking about Myanmar’s transition to democracy, away from aged perspectives .” Indeed, the show re-introduces a misunderstood nation and brings the viewer face to face with the art of its people. For now, the painted figures—much like Myanmar itself—appear to reject the foreigner’s gaze. Yet perhaps at some point, and on more equitable footing, we will look them in the eyes.  Altered State: Painting Myanmar in a Time of Transition will be held at Maya’s Room, Silliman College, from February 24-29. The exhibition is jointly hosted by the Alliance for Southeast Asian Students and the Council on Southeast Asia Studies.        by Holly Chung The Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO) is used to opposition from Yale’s top administrators, who don’t want to negotiate with yet another labor union. But recent public criticism among its own constituents has catapulted GESO into the spotlight in an unprecedented way. An “Open Letter to GESO Leadership” expresses profound concerns about its organizing practices, particularly as these relate to women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color. This renewed criticism of GESO has also come in the wake of heated debates on race and inclusivity on the Yale campus. Days after the publication of the Open Letter in DOWN, GESO’s Coordinating Committee issued a response promising to reform its practices. GESO has agreed to reinstate its Equal Rights and Access Standing Committee; host an open forum regarding its organizing tactics; establish a relationship with Race Forward and other external organizations; and release a statement specifying its progress by March 11. “All of us have made mistakes as we learn how to organize—we are not professional labor organizers, but academics who believe that a union is an essential step on the path to a more just and equitable university,” the letter reads. “A union is only worth having if it truly represents the consensus of its members.” But for many signatories of the Open Letter, consensus still seems far out of reach. Many believe its organizing procedures were not only “mistakes,” as GESO claims, but clear breaches of privacy and dignity, executed in the name of a more “representative” union. For many, GESO will have to do more than merely re-brand itself in order to regain the trust of dissatisfied graduate students. At the time this article was written, the Open Letter carried 148 signatures from current and former Yale graduate students. Attempts were made to contact all of the graduate signatories of the Open Letter. Forty-two graduate students responded to a request for an interview and 24 were interviewed over the course of two weeks. Those interviewed are not representative of the graduate student body as a whole, but do offer an important insight into the conditions that inspired so many graduate students of color, women, and LGBTQ+ students to sign the Open Letter. Across the interviews, graduate students recount systemic harassment, intimidation, and lack of empathy on the part of GESO organizers. However, the interviews also revealed a wide range of opinion on issues such as unionization and confidence in GESO’s planned reforms. The majority of the signatories contacted only consented to give interviews for this article under the condition of anonymity. Some feared retribution from GESO as an organization, while others did not want to implicate their friends. Pseudonyms are demarcated with an asterisk (*). These critics of GESO’s organizing tactics speak out in this exclusive report, which also includes an analysis of the results of a qualitative survey of these Open Letter signatories. The Initial Meeting While GESO claims to represent as much as two-thirds of the student body of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS), Open Letter signatories reported joining the organization before they fully understood its aims and internal politics. During the first few weeks of the academic year, GESO members typically convene an initial meeting for the first-year cohort in each department. Before the initial meeting, a member of one’s own first-year cohort is tapped to be the primary organizer for the new crop of students, while a senior GESO member is assigned to be the primary organizer for the department as a whole. Quentin*, a PhD candidate in Music History (GSAS ’18), said each department’s organizing committee was “tapped” and “groomed” by GESO leadership leadership rather than elected by the students. In small departments, especially in the humanities, Quentin said, there is overwhelming social pressure to joining GESO. Quentin signed a membership card it good faith, but several other interviewees recounted being strong-armed into signing membership cards. One interviewee said their repeated requests for written documentation as to the mission of the organization and its reasons for promoting unionization were denied. Maggie Traylor, a doctoral student in History (GSAS ’20), described the first meeting in her department as extremely “tense,” and said she refused to sign a membership card right away. GESO organizers repeatedly emphasized that GESO already held an overwhelming majority within the History Department, and told her that most of her own cohort had already joined—this in a department with over 20 students per cohort. GESO also claimed to have a significant amount of faculty and administrative support within the department. Traylor said she felt pressured to join GESO because she believed her refusal to join would have serious implications for her friendships and even her professional connections within the History Department. A recent graduate in the sciences who identifies as genderqueer recalled being aggressively petitioned to organize their department in 2014. While they did not claim to be targeted by GESO, they said they might have been “misgendered” as one of the few “women” in their field, and later felt tokenized by the organization. “Through conversations with someone close to the author of the open letter and hearing about some of the stories of other LGBTQ people, I realized that a token was most likely what GESO saw me as,” they said. “I wasn’t a person with an opinion and a past and a story.” They never agreed to serve on the Organizing Committee, but endured two panic attacks during various encounters over several months with GESO organizers. They said these encounters consistently brought back memories of an emotionally abusive relationship, and eventually pushed them to seek therapy by the fall of that year. A PhD student in the humanities said organizers’ recruitment tactics were persistent and violating of personal privacy, not unlike “sexual harassment.” As a person of color, he questioned GESO’s claim to be an organization made up primarily of minorities and people of color, finding it “irritating” that the overwhelming majority of organizers who had approached him had been “elite, rich, white men,” with prestigious degrees from top-tier American and British universities. He said any doubts he expressed about the organization were labeled as conservative, despite his progressive political beliefs. Traylor said that there are likely many more students who are critical of GESO who have been afraid to come forward. While she said she respected many GESO members, and did not want to disparage them, she was more suspicious of those “at the very top of the food chain.” For those like Traylor who have lost confidence in the group, there is no formal membership rescindment mechanism in place. “I believe in a union that wants a real consensus among students, not a mathematical one,” said Luca Peretti, a fifth-year doctoral student in the Italian Department. “They can say a hundred times that two-thirds of the graduate students are GESO members, therefore we have the majority. But we all know how a lot of them became members. What we do not know is how much the two-thirds believe in the union.” Increasing the Pressure After the initial meeting, signatories often experienced increasing pressure to take part in campus-specific campaigns, including canvassing for local political representatives, distributing petitions, and assuming increased levels of responsibility within GESO. “My organizer would ask me to do things,” said a PhD candidate. “I would say no, and she would lean heavily on our friendship to get me to change my mind.” Several signatories felt that GESO representatives deliberately cornered graduate students when they were alone and even emotionally vulnerable, exploiting the fact that graduate school itself is inherently isolating and stressful. One signatory said the tactics resembled “stalking.” Under unrelenting pressure from the organization, Quentin joined the Coordinating Committee (CC) for a brief time, despite his consistent refusal and worsening health issues. While serving on the CC, Quentin and other CC members were consistently pressured to bring in “good numbers” while out canvassing. “The numbers were everything (and some were clearly cooked: I know that we cooked numbers so we wouldn’t be yelled at by our organizers),” he said. “The ends justified any and all means.” Furthermore, as he and many other former CC members would confirm, the CC had little influence with regard to GESO’s policies. Its role was to “rubber-stamp decisions made by the Steering Committee,” Quentin said. Profoundly disillusioned by the inner workings of GESO, Quentin and the other organizers from the Music Department decided to quit the Coordinating Committee. Yet GESO members only pursued them more aggressively, repeatedly confronting Quentin and the Music Department organizers at their homes, unannounced. Quentin received a cancer diagnosis soon after, and before he even had the opportunity to go home and call his family and partner, he ran into his organizer. He did not want to reveal the diagnosis to his organizer, and told him only that it was serious and he needed to get home as soon as possible. His organizer was not at all sympathetic. “At this most devastating of moments in my personal life, he cornered me and accused me of abandoning GESO when they needed me most.” Quentin said, “He said that I didn’t know what was best for myself. He said he was disappointed in me.” Who’s in charge? “Look at the demographics of Steering [Committee] versus CC [Coordinating Committee] and watch much of the diversity go away.” —Former Coordinating Committee member Many signatories cited GESO’s overall lack of transparency as a principal reason for adding their names to the Open Letter. GESO’s response to the Open Letter was signed by the Coordinating Committee, composed exclusively of current graduate students, which GESO claims is its upper-level “elected leadership.” But several signatories noted that the Coordinating Committee in fact occupies only the third-highest level of authority within GESO’s hierarchy, and its election process is far from democratic. Current CC members appoint new members, who are then approved by the CC, some signatories said. Cheryl*, a former organizer and member of the Coordinating Committee, claimed GESO’s main leaders are employed by UNITE HERE: Anita Seth, the Staff Director of Local 34, Yale’s clerical and technical workers’ union, and Jeffrey Boyd, the regional organizing director for UNITE HERE. In email correspondence, Cheryl wrote that she eventually left GESO because she “realized the extent to which Anita and Jeffrey (and by association UNITE HERE) run the entire union and the lengths they will go to get the numbers they think necessary,” “Why are the decision-makers of GESO not even graduate students?” she asked. Under Boyd and Seth is the Steering Committee (SC), made up of approximately ten members, although it’s unclear who sits on the Committee, Cheryl said. The Steering Committee meets every day in a closed-door meeting, but “from the CC meetings, it seems Jeffrey and Anita tell them what to do, and then they pass it down to the CC,” she said. Three other signatories who had been involved in GESO shared the same suspicion about the top-down structure of the organization. Paula*, a PhD student who had been a member of her department’s Organizing Committee (OC) in Fall 2012, said student input about what GESO should be was repeatedly shot down farther up the chain of command. She said their nearly identical responses were “canned,” and she began to suspect that the Steering Committee had in fact told other organizers what to say in advance. Since that time, GESO has indeed implemented some of the ideas that Paula suggested, including creating a Facebook page and hosting several teach-ins, but the organization never credited her for those ideas. “We never got around to doing any of that exciting work we’d thought we’d do because we were so busy trying to get more people to join. It was like a classic pyramid scheme,” Paula said. In its response to the Open Letter, the GESO Coordinating Committee describes itself as “a leadership group made up overwhelmingly of women, people of color and LGBTQ people.” But several former CC members reported that the Steering Committee was overwhelmingly white, heterosexual, and male, at least around late 2014. “Look at the demographics of steering versus CC,” said Cheryl, “and watch much of the diversity go away.” Citywide Stakes GESO’s alignment with the New Haven unions Local 34 and Local 35, representing thousands of Yale employees, places it in the middle of a larger, citywide discussion on the expanding power of a less-than-transparent labor coalition. GESO’s massive rally last year of over a thousand, including the governor, the mayor, and various state representatives, reveals the high political stakes of GESO’s fight for recognition on a larger stage. During the summer following his first year, summer 2013, Quentin said he was pressured to canvass for Toni Harp’s mayoral campaign, even though he did not personally support her, citing “allegations of corruption and negligent property management that have been leveled against her family for decades.” His organizers confronted him with a choice: walk in support of Harp, or face being viewed as a bad example—as he put it, a “bad member of the union.” “Nevertheless, I was eager to be a good member of the union,” he said. “Like so many others have done, I fell prey to their liberal-conscience guilt-tripping.” Quentin claimed GESO provided its representatives with very little information about the Harp campaign before sending them out into various neighborhoods to solicit support. “I came to recognize a hard truth,” Quentin said. “We weren’t being sent out to convince voters with real details about policies candidates actually represented.” GESO has also become an important player in Yale’s relationship to Locals 34 and 35. In an email sent out by Marcy Kaufman, the graduate registrar of the History department, she wrote that Locals 34 and 35 were facing “serious issues of attrition,” and implied that a new union, GESO, might help to fill the void. She also warned that the burden on faculty as well as graduate teachers would increase tremendously with the University’s plans to add two new residential colleges, and urged graduate students to demonstrate their solidarity with all the employees of the University by contributing to GESO’s Fall 2014 photo campaign. “In order to shift the conversations with the University,” she wrote, “we need to show our support for GESO and solidarity with each other.  I’m asking you to take a stand.” Kaufman did not respond to a request for an interview. Representing Graduate Students The question of unionization has acquired a new urgency in the face of an imminent ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on whether graduate students at private, nonprofit universities should be classified as employees. A ruling in favor of this classification could force a vote among Yale graduate students as to whether or not they would agree to be represented by GESO. Half of the signatories interviewed said they would not consent to be represented by GESO in its current incarnation, but a quarter expressed some ambivalence, saying they were not sure, or would only agree to be represented by GESO if it demonstrated significant reform. Only 8% of interviewees said they would agree to be represented by GESO if the issue were to be put to a vote tomorrow, yet those in this group also articulated significant misgivings about GESO. A first-year PhD student in the humanities said she would only vote “yes” because she was unaware of any alternatives, but did believe in unionization.  Peretti said that while reforms are in order, representation by GESO would be better than not having a union at all. “We desperately need a union that can represent us and speak for us, and we need a contract that recognizes our labor,” Peretti said. “A bad union can be improved and changed, a non-existent union cannot.” When pressed, the overwhelming majority of respondents could not envision any current organization other than GESO that would take up the unionization effort, though it is apparent that many wanted an alternative. “GESO takes up all of the air space,” Traylor said. Another second-year doctoral student observed that GESO had perhaps created the perception of a complete monopoly on the cause of graduate students’ rights. “Opting out of GESO does not preclude an individual from believing in, advocating for, and advancing the causes that GESO itself advances,” she said. “But GESO wishes to eradicate this alternative, to monopolize its proletarian agendas.” A small fraction of interviewees, however, saw other existing avenues for political representation within the University. A doctoral student in the humanities said he supported the idea of “a body of elected representatives [that would] advocate for our interests,” but did not want to be represented by GESO. Rather, he claimed the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) already fulfilled this role, explaining that the organization “has a history of working productively with Yales administration, and […] has achieved significant advances, the latest notable one being a marked improvement in graduate funding packages.” Other sources mentioned that alternative political work apart from unionization could also be done within existing organizations, for example the Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS), and organizations such as the Graduate Association of French Students (GAFS), which allows students to serve as faculty-student liaisons within the French Department. Some interviewees, on the other hand, supported more grassroots movements. Quentin, for example, said he would favor a coalition led by the signatories of the Open Letter. “After dealing with GESO, I just stopped thinking about [a union]. I knew I didn’t want GESO to be it.” Traylor said. I decided to put my head down and focus on classwork because that’s what I came here to do.” Hope for GESO More than a third of interviewees had absolutely no confidence that GESO would carry out the reforms proposed in the Open Letter. While insisting on the general honesty of many GESO representatives, Paula said she expected more from GESO’s response to the Open Letter, namely an appropriate admission of guilt, as well as greater recognition of the demands of the Open Letter. “I had hoped that they would acknowledge that [the] specific organizing tactics the letter describes […] are violent and inappropriate,” Paula said. “I’d hoped that the CC would promise to ban those tactics, and to re-train organizers accordingly. I had also hoped that GESO would hire an external advisor, as the letter demanded.” Paula went on to express her frustration that GESO also did not consent to reevaluate its relationship with UNITE HERE. Rather, she suggested that GESO relied on the demographic structure of the Coordinating Committee as a bargaining chip, and as insurance against further criticism. “Instead they just told us that there were lots of women, LGBT people, and people of color on the CC,” said Paula. “We know that. The problem isn’t about individuals; the problem is structural.”  Despite fierce criticism of GESO as it stands today, more than a fifth of survey participants were optimistic that the reforms proposed by GESO will be carried out. “I really hope that most of the people who are in this are in it for the right reasons,” said Traylor. She was pleased to see that GESO had issued a response to the Open Letter and did acknowledge these complaints to some degree through this gesture. “That seems to be progress to me in some way, shape, or form,” she said. *Names have been changed to protect the anonymity of contributors.

Moses Goods worked as a cultural educator at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop museum and practices both Hawaiian hula and storytelling. He studies and performs a range of performance arts, from kabuki to noh to West African dance. Duke tells the true story of a Native Hawaiian surfer-turned-Olympic athlete, Duke Kahanamoku. Kahanamoku dropped out of high school to financially support his family and spent his free time surfing in Waikīkī. After winning two gold and two silver Olympic medals in 100-meter freestyles between 1912 and 1924 and traveling to compete in surf competition around the world, Duke Kahanamoku became a Native Hawaiian icon in surfing and tourism. The play is both a biography and a discussion of the historical, cultural, and social context in which it takes place. The play mentions the annexation of Hawaiʻi, uses the Hawaiian language, and compares Kahanamoku’s views about water and the natural world to those of the Ojibwe, another indigenous community. The Yale Indigenous Performing Arts Program (YIPAP) invited Moses Goods to perform Duke at Yale after the program director, Cherokee lawyer and playwright Mary Kathryn Nagle, read the script for Duke at Goods’ request. Duke represents what YIPAP seeks to do – support Native artists who wants to represent themselves and their own histories through theater and other performing arts. Mary Kathryn Nagle leads the program with the help of American Studies professor Ned Blackhawk, the faculty coordinator, and four Native student workers. Founded just last year, YIPAP student workers participate in Indigenous performing arts by helping coordinate performances, figuring out logistics for different venues and actors, and sometimes acting in productions.        by Ashia Ajani At the introduction of a Jook Songs meeting in Swing Space, everyone checks in by passing around an object – sometimes a watermelon – saying their name, their pronouns, and an honest recollection of how they’ve been doing. One member confides, “it feels really good to be in this space.”  Jook Songs is Yale’s collective of Asian poets, presenting powerful, personal narratives that highlight the multiplicity of the Asian experience. What does it mean to be Asian and an international student? Or mixed race? What does it mean to be Asian and not speak your parents’ tongue?  After introductions, the group jumps into business. Lately the group is very freshman oriented. They plan tours and showcases, and even prompt the writing that gets done during meetings. Sometimes there’s a prompt, sometimes there’s a workshop; members have the chance to workshop their response to the prompt or share work with the group.  Members of Jook Songs are staunch supporters of student art on campus – especially art by other people of color. Many attend plays and spoken word performances by Yalies of color, and express interest with collaborating with other poetry groups on campus. Some members of Jook Songs are part of other groups on campus, but many started off with Jook Songs, and claim this group as their grounding community.  Jook Songs will be performing at the Asian American Writers Workshop in New York City on March 25th at 6:30 pm. There will also be a Yale show in the Calhoun Cabaret at 7:30 pm on April 1st and 2nd.         by Agnes Enkhtamir We linked eyes across a crowd of gyrating teens and music so loud your bones vibrated. I didn’t want to meet the love of my life at a mediocre house party in a suburb of Las Vegas, but his eyes made the dusty, dreamy scene stumble into focus. It was like a fairytale. He was obscenely attractive, and we were wearing the same shade of blue.  He smiles at me, and I smile back. I break eye contact quickly though because I feel a pain in my upper chest – maybe it’s angina – but more likely it is a byproduct of our eyes meeting. I start to get annoyed. Who does this boy think he is, giving me heartburn?  I forgive him instantly when I see that he’s starting to slink around his friends to get closer to me. The organs in my upper chest spin circles.  “HEY!” he has to scream to be heard above the music, but it’s not really a scream. It’s low and intimate and I suddenly need to pee. I brush away the hair sticking to my painted lips and assault him with the most dazzling smile I own. “HI!” Smiling is shown to increase perceived attractiveness, according to both Cosmo and a 1999 study published by Evolution and Human Behavior.  Now that I’ve performed all the ritual tasks required of two people who meet, I have to tell him my name.  I hesitate. “DULGUUN!” I yell. The boy tilts his head slightly to the right and furrows his beautiful brow before yelling “I’M SORRY, WHAT?” over the music. We’re now almost chest-to-chest. Being around him is sort of intoxicating in a way I’m not so sure I like. He has blonde hair and blue eyes and looks like an All American BoyTM. I don’t know what to say. I falter before deciding. “MY NAME IS AGNES!” I smile through the indecision. He’s talking about the party, and he’s leaning in.  The music is loud enough to destroy away any lingering unheard pieces of my name. Dulguun is a clumsy word in English. It’s too round and hard for white tongues to pronounce. Shouting Agnes is easier sometimes.  “WHAT’S YOUR NAME?” I figure I have to call him something less dramatic that The Boy in my diary later.  The Boy says something just as the beat drops in the background. I missed his name. David? Daniel?  David/Daniel leans in. I can smell his woodsy cologne mixed with sweat and alcohol.“SO DO YOU LIKE LACROSSE?” he shouts. He smiles.  What a non sequitur. I’m only confused for a second, though; talking to attractive boys who never had to learn how to talk to girls is an art form I have down pat. Well, it’s not an art form as much as it is agreeing and giggling.  “LOVE IT!” I don’t. “DO YOU PLAY?” He places his hand on my back. The heat from his hand radiates into me. His cheeks are rosy with liquor, but his eyes are warm and clear, ready to laugh: an easy crowd to please. “YEAH!” David/Daniel smiles down at me, moves both hands to my hips, and pulls me closer than would be allowed at PG-13 movie. “LET’S GO OUTSIDE! WHERE IT’S QUIETER!”  We fight our way through the bodies and out the door to a swing set nearby. The cool air is instantly sobering and soft on my skin. I am excited to be on the swings and in the air. They were my favorite when I was younger. If you worked really, really hard, and put enough effort to go the highest the swing would allow, at the very top you would float. Nothing could touch you. He plants himself right in front of my swing. He pulls me closer to him. The stars never really shine in the city like they do in books and songs, but they seem a little brighter tonight. Maybe it’s because they’re quietly enthusiastic about me meeting the love of my life, David/Daniel. He smiles sleepily a couple of inches away from my face. I can feel my adrenal glands releasing a whole slew of chemicals in preparation. I am sure he is going to kiss me. I have never kissed anyone before. I am sure I would be terrible at it. I also don’t know if I want another person’s tongue in my mouth. My mouth has just enough tongues in it already; another would just be crowded and maybe my tongue would not appreciate another tongue in it’s home. My hands start sweating.  He looks at me for what feels like a good thirty seconds before he drops his eyes to ground. “You know what would look great?” “No…” Does he not want to kiss me anymore? Wow all that drama for absolutely nothing. At least I have more time now to research smooching techniques in preparation for the next time he pulls me closer to him.  Which is now. He is coming closer to me right now. Shit. Because of my spotty work ethic, I’m going to ruin our first beautiful moonlit kiss with too much saliva and too little tongue. “What would look great?” “Your tiny Asian hands wrapped around my big dick.”  I can feel the blood draining from my face, my heart rate rises, my mouth is suddenly dry. He’s not looking at me the way he’s supposed to.  Instead, David/Daniel is looking at me the way spoiled boys accustomed to getting everything they want look at new toys. I don’t know what to do. I do not want to be a new toy. I know what I am supposed to do. I am supposed to push David/Daniel out of the way. I am supposed to tell him that he is taking part in fetishizing an entire ethnicity. I am supposed to tell him that I am not a slanted eyed blow up doll. I am supposed to do a lot of things.  I know how I should’ve looked, what I should’ve said, what I should’ve done.  He smiles and takes my hand in his – such an innocent thing to do. He guides my hand to his crotch. He tells me, in the same low voice, “Suck it, too.” I came home forty minutes later with salty cheeks and sticky hands, confused and angry and sad… but also smug, a little happy. David/Daniel chose to objectify me. He chose to make a move on me.  That must mean I meet some standard. He didn’t like me the way I wanted him to, but he still wanted Agnes. Kind of.  “Dulguun.”  I love the way my mom says my name. Her voice carries a playful lilt to it, even when she’s angry. She’ll tell me that my name conveys the way water barrels into stone on a beach, but how the water wins. I don’t understand this. “Dulguun!” I can make peace with the way my teachers used to say my name. It was hard for them, but they jumped through firey hoops of the hard “d” and the subtle double u’s. They tried. I’m not sure if they were correct, but my teachers tried. I’m actually not sure how to say my name in English. I write it on forms and wince when I hear “dull goon.”  Names are important. They’re kind of what anchor you to the world. Your parents choose it, but after a certain age, you can make the decisions. I spot him by the bar. This one has bushy eyebrows and stubble, and he’s laughing with his friends. He’s saying something, excited and impatient for the words to come out, and once they do, the group starts laughing. I smile at him, and he smiles back.        by Joseph Zordan  The representation of Native Americans in media has been one of complicated nature, especially with movies. The way Native Americans have been included in modern, mainstream, and historical, films fall into distinguishable categories. The first, and most common, is the secondary plot role in movies.  This is the role that happens when the presence of Native American is necessary in the time period (especially the case with Westerns).  Filmmakers know they cannot get away with omitting Indigenous American’s Existences, thus a secondary plot role is given to either an individual or small group of whatever tribe is relevant to the setting.   This individual or group can be based on real-life Native Americans of some notoriety, or just whatever name comes to the mind of the creators of film, the average American won’t be able to tell the difference.  This plot line essentially remains entirely irrelevant to the actual plot, or only intersects with the main storyline to allow the previously mentioned Native American to do one of two things.   One storyline is to belittle the white main character and his skills.  This establishes and allows for  the main character tooutshine the indegenious group later in the film and save them. This  is based on the assumption that Indigenous people can never be as skilled or smart as the white savior selected for the plot line.  The other role is for this individual or group involves  getting  murdered.  Through the murder of whatever Native American that so graciously attend this story, the director can drive home points of genocide as well as keeping the lovely stereotype of the “Noble Savage,” still going.  This is great as it allows for white audiences to alleviate some of their white guilt, because the white main character most likely was on their side, couldn’t stop their murder, and thus “not all white people,” were responsible for the genocide of the Indigenous People of America.   This role can also be extended to entire tribes, because as, once again, our common knowledge dictates, all Native Americans are dead in our modern day and age.   TThis plot line and character archetype leads us to another common role: the free Native Americans woman love interest.  That’s right. You, strong indigenous women of the Americas get the honor of getting saved by and then marrying the white male protagonist!  I mean who wouldn’t want to do something such as become this man’s life partner when this stranger rolls into your home and somehow outshines all the other potential bachelors in your community in literally all areas possible.  Are you part of a tribe well-known for their horseback riding? Congratulations! This white man is an expert horseback rider after only one montage, while your previous suitor has only been riding his entire life, but clearly indigenous men are just inadequate.  Bow and arrows? Psht, he has them mastered  a matter of minutes.  While this plotline is often portrayed as romantic , it is usually symbolic of the act of “civilizing” of the savage,as \ you   witness the character abandon her home, traditions, etc. for this new man.  It frequently turns tragic.   This is especially the case if she has a child by the “white savior” of her tribe, as once you’ve reached motherhood you’ve done all essentially you can as a Native American woman  This is after the Native woman  personally saves him, often from  her own people.  Shortly after she has her son, her character becomes fodder for even MORE white man pain, as well as white guilt alleviation to some extent, because she most likely will die under similar genocidal circumstances.  A similar role to achieved through the sidekick archetype. This role we often see reserved for male outcasts of Indigenous communities.  Here his Native American experience  provides comedic relief, and might  include saving  the hero once or twice But  only because he saves the white protagonist later in the movie from much more dire circumstances.   This is a unique role as opposed to the previously mentioned ones as when one is the sidekick, you get to not die!He simply can’t when one is in this role, he’s too lovable to the audience, and his tragic backstory doesn’t need more tragedy as the rest of his community either hates himfor some obscure reason or is dead.  It is in these roles you see the continued appropriation and perpetuation of the myth of monolithic Indigenous communities by mainstream movie producers.  The roles played by Native Americans actors , if they even are actually played by Native Americans, are limited, unimaginative, and more often than not end up like all the other representations of Native Americans’s in American Consumer culture: witha skull with a war bonnet.   While Leonardo DiCaprio has used his position as a well known actor to comment on the importance and significance of Indigenous people in his recent nominations and acceptance, one still can’t help but be critical of the movie that got him there.  The Revenant, while noted for its cultural relevance and accuracy, still missed the mark with actual Indigenous characters in the movie.  At the end of the day, what is rewarded in the modern film industry for Native Americans is not their roles, their culture, or their abilities, but their deaths and ability to compliment the story of the white male hero. I guess, in the very least, can say how impressive it is how art imitates life.         by Isadora Milanez originally published in Broad Recognition  On March 7, 2016, Students Unite Now launched a website demanding the elimination of the student income contribution at Yale. The website contains the efforts of over two months of conversations about financial aid in which students whose situations ranged from full financial aid to no aid at all shared why they believe Yale will be a better place without the student income contribution.  The results are striking. As I read the narratives  my own, those of the people I interviewed, and those shared by others  I think about the Yale I was promised when I first attended an information session in my public high school’s tiny library.  This Yale made a few promises: that it would bring together people of different backgrounds, that it would give students the aid they needed, no matter their financial situation, and that we were all here to be a part of “a tradition, a company of scholars and a society of friends.”  What I see today is that this Yale exists for some students, but that, for many others, it does not. Perhaps even more disappointing, Yale brings together students of vastly different backgrounds, but rather than serve as an equalizer in academic experience, produces systems that stratify students based on class and race.  Look around and see who works twenty hours a week at their student job, who is taking out loans despite the no-loan promise, and who gets to put those twenty hours into their academic and extracurricular passions. There are two Yales, and the one that we were all promised goes to students who have class and racial privilege.  The narratives on the SUN website highlight the ways in which Yale undermines the great talent it recruits by keeping its students from the work they truly want to do. We were all accepted equally, but we cannot exercise the same intellectual and emotional freedom. Students dealing with issues of mental and physical health, sexual assault, and the emotional burden of being a student of color on campus should never be subject to the compounding financial strains that the student income contribution imposes on them. Why does a university with so much power to redistribute resources and so little to lose by doing so create situations in which the daily survival of its students is at stake? I hope that, after four years at Yale, I will pursue a graduate program. Every day, I think about the incredible, talented students at Yale who face undue barriers to achieving their academic goals, because they are working more hours than they can handle to keep their financial situation secure. Yale can and should do better. A campus without a student income contribution is a campus that is better for everyone.        By Treston Codrington When the organizers of Yale’s Religion and Film Series selected “Religion and Social Change” as this year’s theme last spring,  co-organizer Dr. Briallen Hopper says, “we couldn’t have foreseen the way these movements for social change would come to Yale.” In fact, the series screened the documentary A Time for Burning the same day that students confronted Dean Jonathan Holloway with their stories on Cross Campus, and faced off with Master Christakis at Silliman College. On March 3rd, social activist and public theologian Rahiel Tesfamariam, Yale Divinity ’09 expounded on the link between religion and social justice with her multimedia presentation “Faith and Social Change in the Digital Era.”  The talk focused on one year—2011—when the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street sparked levels of unrest unseen by American audiences since the 1960s and 70s. The murder of Trayvon Martin followed soon in February of 2012, exposing the deep legacy of racism in the United States. According to Tesfamariam, protests in 2011 were defined by social media. “Twitter and Facebook give the public power to present the revolution to the world. It gives the power to shift consciousness,” she observed. Online bloggers, petitions, and images played a key role in exposing Travyon Martin’s murder to national and international scrutiny. When Michael Brown was shot and killed in 2014, the unarmed teen’s stepfather was first to post a picture holding up a poster condemning the police for Brown’s murder. #Ferguson and #HandsUpDontShoot immediately became among the most recognizable hashtags in recent history. Tesfamariam’s talk also emphasized the role of faith in modern civil rights movements. Churches have been centers of organization and spiritual leaders, visible both at the frontlines of marches and in the handcuffs of the police. Moreover, she explained, “I serve a Jesus that constantly tells people on the margin to come into the fold. I believe Jesus says, ‘I stand with Ferguson and Baltimore.’” “If you don’t see Jesus that way,” she continued emphatically, “we don’t worship the same God.” Tesfamariam founded Urban Cusp, a popular lifestyle magazine blending issues of faith, urban culture, modern media, and global issues in 2011. She has actively participated in and organized protests against the systematic destruction of Black bodies. “Faith and Social Change in the Digital Era” was a part of the annual Religion and Film Series co-sponsored by the Institute of Sacred Music, Films at the Whitney, the Program in American Studies, the Department of Religious Studies, the Film Studies Program, and the Center for the Study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion. “I want everyone to close their eyes. Imagine you only have one minute left to live. Who is beside you?” “I’ve only done this once before,” was Emi Mahmoud’s simple preface to this request. Thoughts and faces of loved ones flickered through the minds of the crowd surrounding the Women’s Table on Cross Campus. We had come together to honor the lives of three young Black Sudanese-American men—two of them Muslim—shot and killed in Fort Wayne, Indiana the week before. We call them Our Three Brothers, but their names were Mohamed Taha Omar, Adam Mekki, and Muhannad Tairab. Two were cousins of our classmate Emi Mahmoud, ’16. The youngest—Muhannad Tairab—was only seventeen years old. The killings were greeted largely with silence from mainstream media and government officials. What little information did emerge was filtered through ominous stereotypes. One of the vigil’s organizers, Daad Sharfi 17, remembers reading articles for days only to realize that they were all “basically hinting at gang violence, hinting at a drug-related incident, hinting at things that would stereotypically be associated with Black bodies and to Black people. But without any kind of evidence.” Against this hostile backdrop, the Cross Campus vigil was its own statement. Ishrat Manaan 17, another organizer, said, “We’re choosing to not let this be a meaningless blip in current events.” Our Three Brothers were killed in a national climate where Islamophobia and anti-Blackness are rampant, even deadly. Just an hour before being interviewed, Sharfi—a junior in Ezra Stiles College—was asked twice whether she was a terrorist by a stranger at Blue State Coffee on York Street. “I just wanted to get out of there,” she recalls. And yet—“My immediate thought was, ‘Wow, that’s really sad to me, that that question being posed to me does not surprise me.’ ” At the vigil, Mahmoud asked her audience to think of whom we’d want with us in our last thirty seconds of life, and implored us to contact them immediately after the ceremony. To Mannan, these words demonstrated that the fight against injustice “can be a personal and emotional one.” She continued: “It’s when you show [those affected] that they’re loved, and show them that they’re appreciated, and cherish them. Those are acts of resistance and remembrance.” DOWN Magazine remembers and cherishes those affected by Islamophobia, racism, and police brutality as a whole. We honor and extend Emi Mahmoud’s poignant invitation to love, heal, and hope.        by Yuni Chang “I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background.” – Zora Neale Hurston Outside the quaint suburban home of an all-American white couple, an expelled member of the KKK readies himself for an explosive entrance with noose and gun in hand. When his initial targets – the Black neighbors across the street – enter the peculiar mix, what follows is a gruesome chain of events that sets fire to the bloody contradictions of racial politics and liberal consciousness in the Obama-era white American psyche. White History, a play that confronts the violence and toxicity of whiteness and white spaces, comes to the stage at an unbelievably appropriate time: in the aftermath of national student protests for racial and gender justice, the creation of an institutionally supported center for ethnic studies, and campus-wide conversations about privilege and the meaning of inclusion. Dave Harris, director and author of the play, is the second Black playwright in the history of the Dramat to have his work featured and produced. His patience with white audiences has run thin, and he is not about to let their next theatre excursion be a palatable foray through a “post-racial society.” White History forces white people to see the ugliness of their power up close, and the play does not shy away from naming the death count embedded in their skin. “Someone once asked me if I was proud of America’s racial progress. My response was to burst out laughing,” Harris says. “People like to distance themselves from America’s past, as if we were not all the sons and daughters of our history. White History puts our typical ideas of racism in context with our ideas of innocence and colorblindness. Just because you’re not wearing a hood doesn’t mean you do not have work to do. And you definitely have work to do.” White Yalies: I saw you when you stood by the sidelines during the March of Resilience, and smirked as if you knew better. I saw you when you threw your copy of the Yale Daily News in the trash, when its cover story was about how students of color were organizing for a more equitable, accountable university. I saw you chuckle, gawk at, and belligerently antagonize the pain of Black, Latinx, and Native students with your willful ignorance and open mouths. I dare you to reckon with what you have inherited. See this play, and hear it. White History is playing at the Yale Repertory Theatre from Thursday March 31 to Saturday April 2. You can purchase tickets at dramat.org under the box office tab. You’re not ready for this shit.        by Claire Sheen  Dylan Marron, voice of Carlos on Welcome to Night Vale, star of web series Whatever This Is, creator of the YouTube series and Tumblr blog Every Single Word, and member of the New York Neofuturists, came to Yale in February for a talk called “Every Single Word: Racial Erasure in Pop Media.” His latest project was an Every Single Word live show, which was set up as an Oscars viewing party in response to #OscarsSoWhite. The ticket sales were then donated to the “Made in NY” PA training program, an organization helping low-income New Yorkers in the film industry. Dylan’s visit was sponsored by the Yale Humanist Community. Before speaking to a crowd in Davies Auditorium, Dylan sat down with DOWN to discuss activism, pop media, and where the two collide. Q: First, I want to congratulate you on your blog being nominated for the Shorty Awards. A: Big stuff. Q: Yeah, what is it like having that recognition? A: It’s really cool. I think to be able to make something that has a social justice message, and to create a ripple in the pop sphere is very important. And we’ve seen that a lot. You know, this is not exceptional. But I do think that that is one of the most potent ways to get a message across, is through pop culture. And it’s funny because within our side of things, we see a lot of what people are doing with each other. About what is the right way to get this message across? And I feel very strongly that that pop message is very crucial to a movement. It is by far not the only thing that we need. We need the radicals, we need the revolutionaries to start the ripple. But to have the message amplified is totally important. And yeah, so to be nominated for something like the Shorty awards is a big honor. For that very reason. Q: [For the Every Single Word live show,] you’re using the Oscars. And there’s kind of a humor to that. Do you think that’s important? A: Yeah, totally. Fully. And it’s the same humor that, I think, made Every Single Word watchable. Which is like, there is something funny about Every Single Word. And it’s because it is funny that you start thinking about it. And really, I believe that’s how you change minds. Q: So is accessibility the reason why humor is important? A: Right, and humor is the same as entertainment. And it’s like: when you are having fun, you are more willing to learn something. And this can go two ways. If you look at the misogyny and violence in a lot of pop media—let’s take video games—kids don’t know that they are inhaling and absorbing misogynistic messages. But they are. And it’s the same with movies. We don’t know we are inhaling and absorbing racial stereotypes, but we are. Because we’re being entertained, and that’s what’s dangerous. Like, in watching movies, we are figuring out who we are. We are developing a sense of empathy. Q: What is it like having this identity both as a biracial person in the media and as a queer person in the media? A: Wow. Thanks for that question. It is—I mean, being—it’s really tough. I think because when you are just one minority, people are already obsessed with figuring you out. I mean especially because the gatekeepers are sometimes the storytellers. They have decided what is Latino enough. They’ve said, oh, this is Latino. This is what Latino looks like. This is what gay looks like. And when you are more than one, you complicate that, right? And I think especially with being biracial. I mean, the real thing I feel—I just feel like I don’t know what tribe I belong to. And that’s how I’ve been talking about that. And I feel that, you know, that has followed me, too, professionally. I mean, am I a writer? Am I an actor? Am I an activist? And, you know, I do a monthly show at the UCB. Am I a comedian? I mean, I don’t know. Because I don’t see my reflection in that, I’m like, no, I’m not a comedian. But I’m also not an activist, because I do my activism through art. And I’m not just an actor. I write to perform things. Or write to direct. But yeah, that’s the easiest way to say it: I don’t know where my tribe is. Do I belong to the gay community? Am I Latino enough to belong to the Latino community? And that’s so funny, because I can ask that, and there’s no questioning. And yet, if I said, am I white enough to belong to the white community? our heads would, like cock a little to the side. It’s, it’s just hard. It is a challenge to be outside of everything. And being biracial is something I’ve wrestled with since I was young, too. It’s like, because society doesn’t have a box for you, you feel like you don’t deserve a box. You feel like you don’t belong. Racially homeless. Q: I’ve heard that same sentiment, actually, last semester. Together with the student movement, people from the different cultural centers were really mobilizing. And there were biracial students who felt like maybe they weren’t POC enough to have a say. A: Yes. Yes. I know that fully. I know the feeling of being rejected by who you think is your own group. And this came up in a really interesting way recently in the election. When, you know, women who supported Bernie Sanders were being criticized. And that goes on within communities of color too. You know, like, “You are not a real person of color if you aren’t for this cause.” And we’re not talking about big causes that clearly—I mean, Black Lives Matter, it’s like, we’re all on that side. But in the minutia of it all: how to activate, how to organize. And you come under fire more when you are one of these people who toes the line. Q: Does it ever take an emotional toll on you? A: All the time, I think, in ways that I don’t really even know. Because it’s so ingrained. Yeah. Pretty frequently. Can I identify them? No. But identity formation is so crucial and so self-actualizing. It’s actually really hard for me to identify how it has manifested in me, other than the clear ways that I am aware of. Like not feeling Hispanic enough, feeling like what standards am I holding myself up to? In the end, what community do I belong to? Do I belong to any community? So it’s a deep fear of a lack of belonging. Q: When you were growing up, seeing all these white people on TV and in media, was there ever a moment when you finally felt like you could belong in this space? A: No, but I always dreamed of it. And fantasy always kicks in when you just really want to belong. I mean, I always loved that world. And when I saw that I had a talent for acting, and later writing, and that it was something that I felt I could work hard to hone and work on, that’s when I started feeling like maybe there was a place for me in this world. And it really was joining a sketch comedy group in college that really empowered me to be like, oh, I can create my own work. And I can create my own characters, and I can dictate the words I say. And I’m also an ensemble member of the New York Neofuturists. But in spaces like that, you’re just not even thinking about it. You’re making your own work, of course you’re gonna be on stage. And then you step into the more commercial world, the more pop world that we’re talking about. And it’s radically different here. Q: From what I’ve noticed in sketch, and in college comedy, it seems like it’s a lot of white people, and it’s a lot of guys, and it’s a lot of straight guys. Did you think about that in your sketch group? A: Oh yeah. I was one of the only people of color in any comedy group. There were—let me think—just taking my freshman year, I think I was one of three in all comedy groups. People of color. At all. Q: Someone told me once that I’m one of only two Asians in a comedy group on campus. I’ve gone to shows, and I think that’s true. A: That’s crazy. That’s crazy. And it’s interesting how this plays into the comedy world too. There’s a lot of talk about, like PC culture ruining comedy. And it’s just so—that’s another thing that makes me question what my tribe is. It’s like, well, I love comedy, and I love doing comedy, but I don’t know. It’s so interesting to hear people say that [, who have benefited from a former PC culture allowing them in. Do you know what I mean? And to speak to what you said about a largely white comedy community, it’s because that crew has been in comedy for so long. So when you see your reflection in something, when you see your reflection doing something, what that triggers in your mind, especially as your mind is forming, you say oh, I can do that. That I can do, because I see someone who looks like me doing it. And that’s why representation is so important. You know, that there could be more than just one token person that you can look to, to say okay, I’m doing this thing. If you had like, a swarm of Asian comedians that you could look to who all represented something different, clearly they wouldn’t be tokenized. Because all humans are different, so therefore, all Asian comedians would be different. And you would have more confidence. I mean, this is not assuming that you don’t, but I mean there wouldn’t be a question of it. And there’s never a question, aside from talent, for straight white guys going into comedy. There’s never that moment of butwhat do I say? I don’t want to suggest that they are not working hard. Of course they work hard. But I’m saying, they’re working in a way where they never have to question if they’re allowed to do it because of who they are. And that is one of the greatest inhibitors. Q: Have you had role models in media who you’ve felt represented your identity? A: I mean, when I saw Ricky in My So-Called Life, that was huge. But seeing soft-spoken queer brown boys, who are not the butt of the joke? No. Like, no. I love seeing parallel groups be represented. I mean, I think Key and Peele are doing something really cool. They just nail it, talking about the very limited options Black men are given within the mainstream. And seeing Shameik Moore, as the lead of Dope. That is a new model. We just need that in every community. Q: Are you constantly aware of your position as a role model? A: When I meet the fans, specifically of the podcast Welcome to Night Vale, I am. Just because they tell me directly. I am aware. But people who are activists in our art have such a heavy weight to bear. Because you’re thinking about thinking about so many things at once. Is this right? Am I saying this right? Am I offending anyone? Also, honoring the story. Like, separate from activism, am I telling a good, entertaining story? So it’s not like, every moment, your mind is coursing with oh my god, how am I going to represent this character? But like, activism is in our DNA. We know how we want to represent these characters. I know how I want to represent Carlos on Welcome to Night Vale. And he is a full, 3D person who will look like my version of Carlos. So as long as I play the truth of it, and I play my truth, then I don’t have to obsess over is this the right representation? Well, it’s not the only one. I hope there are many other images of Latino men who are not like me, too. Q: Do you feel a pressure to represent your communities well? A: Of course. But then, it also goes back to the tribes question we were talking about, which is like, which community am I representing? I think that’s where I get really tripped up. Who am I standing in for? And I think when I meet, especially the fans of Welcome to Night Vale, especially seeing brown queer kids, and all varieties of brown—when you see someone who looks like you, there’s just a sigh of relief. You know? Ooph, yeah, like that looks like me. And then you feel like you have an avatar there. And if I’m anyone’s avatar, I’m honored by that. Incredible, incredible. It’s an honor. Q: Do you have an end goal, something you’re searching for? A: Sustainability. You know, doing Every Single Word has been amazing. I would like to be telling the stories, rather than just commenting on them. And I’ve been writing a lot. I’ve been auditioning for things. And that is the way to do it. But I want to—no one is just an activist. You have to be an activist through doing things. You know, like, you can’t be a career protester, right? There are so many ways to protest. Every Single Word is a way to protest. Putting together a live show for Every Single Word is a way to protest. Like yeah, it’s a live comedy show. But it’s also a lot more than that. And I hope to keep making work like that. And I hope it can be regular, and I hope it can continue being a regular job. My end goal is to entertain people enough to transmit social justice messages through my work. To change minds through entertainment, yeah. Q: I think I’ve definitely felt that too. Last semester, when things were going on around campus, I did some art projects. I’m in a spoken word group. And I felt like I kind of had one shot to make the other students care. One shot to do something beautiful and brilliant so that they would care. A: And we have to take that pressure off ourselves. Because you’re still a human. A growing human—not to say “you’re in college, you’re still growing.” I mean, we all are. I’m a growing human. If someone else is not going to give you that second chance, you will give yourself the second chance. Because you have to. There’s just no other choice. The work you’re doing now is not going to be nearly as good as the work you’ll be doing in ten years. And you just have to accept that. We just get better. Same with me; the work I’m doing now is not going to be nearly as good as the work I’ll be doing in ten years—so I hope. I can only hope that I will keep getting better. But yeah, I mean especially when you talk in the macro about how Hollywood works, and how if a Black woman directs a movie and it’s a box office bomb, they’ll be like, “Well, that’s it. Never letting a Black woman direct again.” And that happens in the micro too. You just have to find ways to not let that get to you. You will perform spoken word again, if you don’t get a chance from other people. So yeah, it’s exhausting work. But we gotta keep going. Q: So what do you think is the path, on a practical level, to more representation in the media? A: Always question. It’s to always question. If someone says, “Well, that doesn’t make sense for a Latino person to be in a fairytale,” why? Why? Says who? There’s a fire-breathing dragon—just wanna put that out there, but okay. That doesn’t make sense. Or in a fictional, mystical woods, okay. To always question, and to use that point of questioning as a trampoline for making work. And then to keep jumping higher. Q: I’ve heard a lot of complaints about protests and about the student movement, that are like, “Why bring politics into this? Why bring politics into the names of buildings, or Halloween costumes, or frat parties?” Do you run into that same complaint? A: Not with that wording, but yeah. Like “Oh, this isn’t racist. This is just us having a good time.” It’s like, no, but it’s everywhere. You can’t depoliticize it. Politics are everywhere. Politics of representation are everywhere, whether you like it or not. You just don’t like being inconvenienced by being alerted to it. So that’s what it is. It is the fear of what that inconvenience will do to your perception of your security.   Q: Do you think that people my age, college students, have a special role? A: Of course, yeah. Find a way to be an activist in any medium. Activists don’t always stand somewhere holding a sign. There are many ways to stand somewhere and hold a sign. You can do it digitally. You can do it artistically. You can do it literally, you know. And this is not to knock live protests. That’s of course necessary. Especially for representation because you got the cameras there, you know. But there are other ways. And there are ways to slyly include activism. Just keep searching for those ways.        by Ashia Ajani  The Saybrook Underbrook Theater is pitch black. A light slowly brightens up the stage, and a woman in white prison scrubs labeled “SHU” (Security Housing Unit) looks up at a screen. The screen reads: “Mariposa was sentenced to 15 months in solitary confinement for being in possession of tweezers.” From there, the play begins. The play Mariposa and the Saint is transcribed entirely through letters exchanged between an inmate, Mariposa, and her friend. It touches on heartbreaking topics such as the origins of Mariposa, the pressures of solitary confinement, and the “faceless machine” that is the prison industrial complex.  A Corrections Officer, who brings Mariposa food and takes her letters, does not speak, but wears a mask to represent this “faceless machine.” Mariposa herself says, “she doesn’t know what individual person to be mad at” for her situation.  A group reading of a poem, as well as other interactions with the audience, bring the audience closer to the story. Slides in the background relay information about Mariposa’s life to the audience, showing pictures of her daughter, who Mariposa hasn’t seen since she was one week old. The play, though not a musical, uses music to amplify the feelings of the prisoner.  Magic realism plays a very important role in the show, as well as Mariposa’s constant correspondence with “the Saint”: a religious figure who Mariposa turns to for guidance. The screams and sorrow of other inmates in solitary confinement bring Mariposa to ache for her children, and then later for “stranger things,” such as the feeling of grass under her toes.  Mariposa ends up spending the final year of her sentence in solitary confinement due to a technicality. She was supposed to be released June 15th, 2014, but four more years were added to her sentence for throwing a cup of water at a male nurse. She will not get out of incarceration until 2018, when her son, Will, is twenty-one and her daughter, Annabella, is sixteen.  Julia Steele Allen, the actress who plays Mariposa, is a former volunteer for the California Coalition for Women Prisoners (CCWP). She corresponded with Mariposa even before Mariposa’s transfer to solitary confinement. The two women began writing the play in 2012, and the first draft of the play was produced in June 2013. Mariposa and the Saint is on tour with the intent of bringing the horrible conditions of women’s prisons to state legislators attention, hoping to limit or end the use of solitary confinement.  After each performance, there is a panel discussion with the audience. One audience member was previously incarcerated and placed in solitary confinement and talked about his experience transferring back to the “real world” and commented on how previously incarcerated people are “ill prepared to return back to society.” Here at Yale, Allen partnered with the Yale Undergraduate Prison Project (YUPP), a student-run social justice organization that offers outreach to imprisoned people and promotes dialogue around issues about mass incarceration. The discussion focused on Allen’s process, the issues surrounding solitary confinement, and Yale’s involvement in prison development. Yale is focused on advocating for prison reform at a local and state level. They are currently trying to raise the juvenile jurisdiction age in Connecticut to twenty-one.  After the play, audience members were encouraged to write postcards to Mariposa. During the talk with Allen, she mentioned that Mariposa initially did not want her name revealed in the play. In the end, audience members get an intimate look at the life of Mariposa, who was born Sara Fonseca and who is a member of the Mi’Wok Tribe of Northern California. Today, she advocates for the rights of incarcerated women.  Signatures are welcome to the Yale Prison Divestment Open Letter.         by Joseph Zordan  On March 3rd and 4th, scholars from all around the world gathered to discuss their research on environmental and social toxicity at the TOXIC symposium at Yale. The conference opened with a conversation between Chicago-based art professor LaToya Ruby Frazier and another notable Black female activist, Dr. Nana Adusei-Poku. Organizer Professor Vanessa Agard-Jones, of the Yale Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies department, was determined to place the perspectives of Black women on activism, academia, and art in dialogue. This choice set the tone for the rest of conference, in which all panels were led by women or people of color. Topics of discussion included lead poisoning, postindustrial trials and tribulations among the working class, pollution of the great lakes, and the storage of toxic chemicals. In this space, academics from Agard-Jones’ readings – including Frazier, whose work tackles issues such as environmental racism, healthcare inequity, toxicity in Black life in her hometown of Braddock, Pennsylvania – finally had the opportunity to meet. The presentations discussed not only how humans are entangled with toxins from conception, but also how race, class, and gender all factor into the ways in which these toxins are introduced to us. Those unable to attend the event could follow along through social media as Professor Agard-Jones and her team live-tweeted the proceedings, accumulating over 800 retweets and likes during the event. There were also daily blog posts leading up to the event to introduce the topics and conversation. These posts can still be seen at toxicsymposium.org.        by Arturo Pineda  The discussion, “A Muslim Vision of a Life Worth Living” does not start immediately. Muslim members of the audience at Battell Chapel on Wednesday are finishing their maghrib prayers. Tonight, world-renowned Islamic scholar Shaykh Hamza Yusuf will address the age-old question, “What is a good life?” through the lens of Islam. The Shaykh begins by cautioning that a life lived without direction cannot be a good one. For evidence, he reads from the Qur’an: “I swear by the position of the stars.” Here, the stars represent nature’s orientation towards a good life. The quote alludes to human inability to understand Allah if we ignore the stars. Humans must make the conscious decision to view the stars and interpret them. In another passage, Allah speaks to the angels about appointing a caliph, which is a caretaker or steward on Earth. The angels question whether this caliph will sow corruption and shed blood. After all, the previous inhabitants of the Earth were corrupt. However, as Shaykh Yusuf explains, humans can avoid corruption. Islam tells us that humans sow anger when we lose control of ourselves—when emotions take control. These appetites and emotions cause bloodshed and murder. If humans control elements of our nature, we will be able to control our nature and see the path of the stars. The Shaykh concludes with a discussion of possible fundamental sins. It is up for debate whether pride or humans’ distractibility is the more fundamental sin. We are easily distracted by our surroundings because we suffer from profound boredom. This boredom causes man to carry out a myriad of pursuits. These pursuits lead humans on paths that deviate from the moral teachings of the Qur’an. According to Shaykh Yusuf, one must remember that anything not done in the name of Allah is done in vain. As a preface to his speech, Shaykh Yusuf has remarked that Westerners face inherent barriers to comprehension when they first study Islam and the Qur’an. The structure of the holy book is non-linear; most chapters have no clear beginning, middle, and end. Additionally, the Qur’an is written in Arabic, and meaning gets lost in translation. None of this, he says, should deter people from studying Islam. In a society rife with Islamophobia and misunderstanding, this seems like good advice.

All are associated with authority and accord. These gestures are the antitheses to the sweaty, limp handshake at the meeting between President Barack Obama and President Raul Castro on March 22nd. The encounter occurred eighty-eight years after the last visit a sitting American president has made to Cuba. The history of diplomatic ties with the United States is one characterized by trauma. The now viral video of Obama and Castro’s handshake serves as a cautionary foreshadowing of the United States’ involvement with Cuba in the future. In January 1961, the U.S. severed its diplomatic ties from Cuba. The embargo, officiated through the Helms-Burton Act, put a considerable strain on the island’s economy and its relation to Cuban-Americans in the United States. The embargo was reflective of the U.S.’s “rollback” policy of the early 1960s, which deployed economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against leftist governments dependent on support from the United States. Under the governance of Fidel and Raul Castro, Cuba has budged little in its obstinate refusal to compromise with the United States. However, in the last few years, Obama has realized the need for change in American dealings with Cuba. On an island subject to severely restricted access to Internet and other sources of information, repression and detention of political activists and benign figures, and abject poverty and unemployment, the U.S.’s isolationist foreign policy does more harm than good. As Obama proclaimed in his State of the Union address in January 2015: “In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you’re doing doesn’t work for 50 years, it’s time to try something new.” Now working under the assumption that some change is better than none, the Obama administration must decide how to ensure that the Cuban government facilitates this reform movement on the island. Previously, the Cuban government used the embargo as a scapegoat, acquitting itself of any responsibility to implement proactive public policies and improve the quality of life for Cubans on the island. Now, the U.S. is forcing the Cuban government to be accountable for its own people. Those against Obama’s recent foreign policy declarations contend that by easing the embargo and facilitating economic transactions between the island and the U.S., the U.S. will be sapping Cuba of its culture. Many Americans, hope to visit Cuba “before it changes.” They perceive Cuba as a tropical paradise that has remained frozen in time since the 1960s and fetishize the violent poverty that has seized the island. The argument against U.S. involvement with Cuba is based in a paradigm of U.S. exceptionalism. To believe that U.S. trade with Cuba would destroy the remnants of old Cuba is to blatantly ignore the fact that other countries, particularly Spain and Portugal, established commercial ties with Cuba years ago. Just as with any place, the culture of Cuba is in constant flux. This does not devalue the island’s authenticity. The future of Cuba and its relations with the U.S. remain unclear. Like Obama with his limp hand, the U.S. cannot do anything but proceed forward and take everything in stride.        by Ashia Ajani  Kehlani is a twenty year old R;B singer who attempted suicide last weekend after a cryptic Instagram post made the internet think that she had cheated on Kyrie Irving with PartyNextDoor (These accusations were later proven false).  Chris Brown even had some unsolicited words for the singer/songwriter, calling her suicide attempt a ploy for attention. But really, what poignant thing does Chris Brown have to say on the matter of cheating and terrible behavior? And although it was wonderful seeing Tinashe, Zendaya, and a slew of other women block Chris Brown on Twitter, he plays a very small roll in an overall system that demonizes women of color, especially Black women.  Kehlani is a prime target for cyberbullying: a self-identified bisexual woman of color.  When I first saw the Instagram photo of her distinctly tattooed arm with an IV in it, a searing hot wave of shame and anger crept up my throat and spread out over my cheeks. In that moment, I saw so much of myself in Kehlani. As Black queer women, we have to deal with the hypersexualization that comes with being Black, as well as the vilification that is cast upon us for being queer.  A dangerous cocktail of perceived sexual promiscuity, antipathy and exotic “otherness” makes up our bodies. They do not become our own. It is easy for us to become territory for others (especially men) to make assumptions about our actions and desires. When rumors surfaced that Kehlani was cheating  with her ex PND (PartyNextDoor) social media outlets assumed it was true. She has spoken openly about her multiple relationships with men and women alike.  Why wouldn’t she seek affection elsewhere? She can’t make up her mind, so she might as well jump from person to person, satisfying her own sexual appetite and ignoring the feelings of others. I would be lying if I said I hadn’t experienced this kind of scrutiny before, even in relationships I thought were solid and respectful. Here at Yale, mainly because I am away from home, I feel more comfortable being open about my sexuality. Still, there are times I remember past relationships and oftentimes hesitate before telling potential interests I am bisexual.  One of my ex-boyfriends asked me if I ever slept with my best friend because I talked so much about her (never mind the fact that she was my best friend and we were going to separate colleges across the country). Another “joked” that he would be open to threesomes, but only with other women. A girl I briefly dated shut me down after two weeks because I wasn’t a “real” lesbian (I mean, obviously, I’m bisexual).  This kind of treatment is often either in jest, in ignorance or because it has been so normalized by mainstream society. But there is a horrid violence wrapped up in its margins. Bisexual women have the highest chances of rape and sexual assault. We are sometimes “correctively raped.” We have the highest rates of intimate partner violence.  And, as shown by responses to Kehlani’s suicide/cheating scandal, we have the lowest rates of support after disclosing trauma (in its many forms). Forty-five percent of bisexual women have considered or attempted suicide.  After watching Jazmine Sullivan’s performance of her song “Masterpiece”, at BET’s Black Girls Rock, my eyes glistened. I soaked up all of the Black Girl Magic she was serving up on stage. I don’t usually cry freely, but listening to the words: “As the sun shines on all of my glory / My flaws dont look so bad at all/What was I so afraid of?/ Every part of me is a vision of a portrait/ Of Mona, of Mona Lisa/ Every part of me is beautiful/ And I finally see Im a work of art/ A masterpiece.”         by Alejandra Padín-Dujon On the 31st of March, a who’s who of America’s foremost Constitutional scholars and Reconstruction historians gathered in Linsly-Chittenden Hall for a panel discussion entitled “Equal Protection: Origins and Legacies of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Drafted in 1866 by the Radical Republican contingency of a U.S. Congress still operating without the eleven Confederate states, this amendment establishes the principle of birthright citizenship, guarantees equal protection of the law to all persons, creates a basis for ongoing federal power, and extends the protections of the federal Bill of Rights to every state through a process called incorporation. The all-star panel, which included professors Akhil Reed Amar (Yale Law), Tomiko Brown-Nagin (Harvard Law), Eric Foner (Columbia University), Amy Dru Stanley (University of Chicago), John Fabian Witt (Yale Law), and David W. Blight (moderator, Yale University), criticized the Supreme Court’s record of conservative Fourteenth Amendment rulings, contextualized the amendment’s passage, and expounded upon the document’s implications for modern debates on citizenship, mass incarceration, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the meaning of free personhood. “As a historian, I have no interest in what eight or nine uneducated people have to say about the Fourteenth Amendment,” declared Professor Foner, whose laundry list of accolades includes a Pulitzer Prize in History for his book The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery. “The Supreme Court has consistently chosen the most conservative interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment on the subject of race.” Foner’s scorn was echoed by Professor Brown-Nagin, who noted that the SCOTUS is “deeply involved in the restriction of the Reconstruction Amendments.” In addition to the Fourteenth Amendment, these include the Thirteenth (abolishing slavery) and the Fifteenth (granting equal voting rights). The 1964 Civil Rights Act was effectively a “do-over” of the 1875 Civil Rights Act, which the Court struck down on the basis of federal government overreach. In 2013, the SCOTUS invalidated key portions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act as part of its ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. In many cases, exigent circumstances and historical context that birthed the Fourteenth Amendment have made it too progressive for the tastes of subsequent lawmakers. The document deliberately alternates between referring to the American “citizen” and “any person” in order to negate the effects of the 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, which alleged that Black Americans are not citizens, and that only citizens have Constitutional rights. Now, many Constitutional protections apply even to those without citizenship status. Other provisions in the Fourteenth Amendment have only become thornier with the passage of time. Section 2 permits states to disenfranchise rebels and criminals, thereby denying voting rights to large contingencies of the American population in an era of racialized mass incarceration. The panelists ultimately suggested that the solution to reconciling modern social issues with nineteenth century Reconstruction rhetoric lies in recovering and popularizing accurate historical knowledge in our legal system. Do we actually need a new Voting Rights Act? “No,” snapped Professor Foner. “We need a new Supreme Court!”        by Joseph Zordan  It’s April and as winter seems to be winding down (finally), campus seems very much to be doing the opposite. Facebook events are flying, panlists haven’t been this active since the beginning of the year, and while midterms may be over, finals are beginning to loom over all of us.  With everything happening it is incredibly normal for one to be stressed, in fact it’d possibly more strange if one wasn’t stressed.  While everyone, including myself, feel like now is the time to go to everything humanly possible, it is important to remember the “human” aspect of that sentiment.    Remembering to take time for yourself is one of those things that may just seem like a cliché   I mean who has time to spare here? But its important to evaluate where you are and how you spend your time. If you haven’t seen the daylight for 4 days, maybe it’s time to leave Bass. If you actually have gone to every Facebook event you said you were going to, maybe it’s time to miss one and catch up on a TV show you’ve neglected the past few weeks.  I know all of this is a lot easier said than done, trust me, but nonetheless it’s something that we should all remember and hear.  You deserve a break!  It is also important to remember that sometimes stress can cross the line into something that is more than stress. Whether it’s bringing back something old or brings you into something entirely new.  Regardless of what it may be, know that your mental health is important and that there a variety of resources to help you. To begin with there is the ever present Yale Health.  While experiences differ significantly person-to-person, many people do make use of their services, myself included.  While this can be a rather big step for some, there is absolutely nothing wrong to reaching out for professional health.  Even if it’s just to rant about general aspects of life, a therapist visit can be very much worth your time.   However, if your own experience with Yale Mental Health and Counseling has been less than stellar or you are seeking a more informal setting, there still remains a variety of other options on campus for support and outreach. Walden Peer Counseling is an easy to access service that is provided by other undergraduates.  Whether you make use of their anonymous hotline or walk-in space in Welch Entryway B in room A-05 between 8pm to 1am, Walden provides a very easy to use and more informal setting to sound off and destress. The Chaplains Office is also a great resource for Yalies from all different faith backgrounds (or no faith background)  and can be found in the basement of Bingham.   No matter what you’re going through, know that there are support systems out here for you.  It may not always be the easiest thing to do and reach out, however, it is definitely worth it.  Whether it be a therapist, chaplain, or even a close friend, getting support when things aren’t the best is one of the best things you can do in that situation.  You deserve a break.

(Portland’s bill will raise the minimum wage to 14.75 dollars). The process to achieve the target minimum wage varies widely but the goal is the same: to create a living wage that coincides with the minimum wage. The establishment of living wages will be beneficial to all minimum wage workers, workers who are struggling to live off low wages, and especially workers of color who fall into either category. In the United States, African-Americans, Asians, Latinxs, and Native Americans constitute 42% of minimum wage workers, yet they only represent 32% of the entire U.S. workforce. In certain sectors, like the restaurant industries, the numbers are further imbalanced. In 2014, workers of color accounted for 59% of all dishwashers, and 35% of all fast food preparation workers. Both of these positions are two of the lowest-paid positions in the industry, barely being above the federal minimum wage at $8.48 and $8.78, respectively; clearly not living wages. As a result of an insufficient minimum wage and low wages, poverty afflicts POC communities disproportionately. The total amount of people who live in poverty is estimated to be 14% or 45 million people. Latinx and Black communities alone account for 50% of all people living in poverty, yet they only comprise 28.5% of the total population. It was estimated in 2013, that if the federal minimum wage had been raised to $10.10, six million people would have been raised out of poverty. Of those 6 million, 3.5 million, 60%, would have been POC. Raising the minimum wage gap aids in closing the race-gender pay gap between POC communities and white male workers. On average, Black men and Latinos earns 71% of what a white male earns, while Black women and Latinas earn make 62% of a white man. Closing the wage gap is vital as many of the fastest-growing industries offer low-wage positions, which are disproportionately held by women and people of color. The most beneficial aspect of of the minimum wage is that it will allow POC communities to climb out of perpetual income disparity. Currently the median income for white families is 20 times higher than Black families, and 18 times higher than Latinx communities. Once POC communities are able to accumulate capital, they will able to purchase higher costs goods, and ultimately obtain a higher standard of living. The goal will be for no one with full-time employment to live in poverty.        by Eugene Lim  I was lathering shampoo into my hair when I froze, struck by an unwelcome thought. I rummaged through my sleep-deprived brain. It was the first day of Chinese New Year. Shit. I shut off the water and almost hopped out of the shower. For a few seconds I hovered over the threshold, clutching my towel. My father had always warned me never to wash my hair on the first day. An old superstition: it would wash away all my luck for the rest of the year. I watched my last dregs of good fortune swirl leisurely down the drain with a creeping sense of doom. But suddenly, I had a flash of inspiration: it wasn’t the first day of Chinese New Year. Singapore, my home, was twelve hours ahead of New Haven. Saved by time zones. Just to be safe, I dried off my hair. It took a while before I grasped the absurdity of my logic. And yet, for a few seconds, it made perfect sense. In a way, it still does. There’s a common phrase Chinese people learn early on in life: yin shui si yuan. When drinking water, remember the source. Remember your roots, and give thanks. It is an apt phrase for a people who are always on the move, always seeking new shores. My grandfather’s tablet rests at the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple in Malacca, named after the ocean-spanning Admiral Zheng He. Several generations ago, my ancestors left China and joined the Nanyang Chinese diaspora, a wave of hungry fishermen, landless sailors, and lost refugees seeking new homes in the South Seas. In the tropical peninsula of Southeast Asia, some built temples dedicated to the goddess Mazu, patron deity of fishermen and sailors. In life, she took the family name Lin – the same name I inherited from my parents. A simple character consisting of two smaller, identical characters. Mu: wood. Lin: forest. Remember your roots, and give thanks. I wore a lucky red sweater for the first day. As the story goes, the mythical beast Nian terrorized the countryside, until one day a god took pity on the people and revealed the Nian’s weakness: the color red. The villagers, decked out in red and brandishing firecrackers, chased away the Nian. And so they lived happily ever after until the next year, when a harsh winter drove the hungry Nian back to the villages. A new ritual began, an annual battle against terror with crashing cymbals and firecrackers and clothes in lucky colors. This year, I picked an old H;M Christmas sweater snatched from a Black Friday rack. It was a suitably garish shade of crimson, the kind that is carefully selected to suggest intentionality. An act of rebellion, perhaps, in a sleet-and-grey world buried under speckled mounds of snow. Back home, I would have blended right in. Old rituals feel quaint here, as if they are quirky cultural curiosities with no real power. George Eliot suggested that the olds gods were chained to the lands of their worship: So that a man could cross the bordering heights and be out of the reach of his native gods. Just like the legend of the Nian always sounded like a fairy tale or a child’s bedtime story, my familiar habits are becoming eccentric, displaced. The grip of home loosens with each new hour and mile away. Back home, this would’ve been unlucky. Back home, that means good luck. But not here. My red Christmas sweater becomes an anti-talisman, calling rather than warding, calling for myth and superstition to return and be un-banished. In the old days, new arrivals in a strange and unfamiliar land would build temples to retrieve their gods. All I have are my scraps of tradition. We are all trying to remember. The Malaysian and Singaporean Association’s Chinese New Year dinner is festooned with paper lanterns, calligraphy, and food smuggled through customs. (I remember Heathrow: the officer holds up the little packets of Milo and squints. It’s just a motley crew of Mom and the kids, on the way to Canada to meet Dad. What is this? Mom tries to explain, but is stuck. We call it Milo. It felt like trying to describe an elephant to an alien. Where do you start? An elephant is an elephant is an elephant. Milo is Milo. It’s uh… like hot chocolate… a powder drink. He breaks a packet open, sniffs, and throws everything away. Enjoy your stay.) There is Milo and pineapple tarts and kueh and curry and cereal prawn and love letters. Love letters: thin wafers embossed with lucky symbols and folded into cylinders. It is said that lovers would write messages in them, whispering sweet nothings via pastry. A gastronomic courtship. I pick one up, briefly consider its ten-thousand-mile elopement to New Haven slipping past the TSA, and take a bite. Bliss. The pile of clandestine snacks disappears in minutes. Chinese pop songs I never listened to back home blare over the speakers while I struggle to remember the traditional greetings. How do rituals gain their power? They must be taken for granted. You must be steeped in the daily fabric of petty superstitions and habit, until what you do seeps into simply what is. They assume the nonchalance of the real, existing alongside showers and food and clothes as if that is how it has always been. Until one day someone asks what’s this? and you try to find the words to explain but you can’t. The magic vanishes where it has no history, where it needs explanation. The gods of ritual are aloof and capricious; they will not be summoned by the simple act of ritual. They must be cajoled and seduced into a new land. They require sincere supplication. Above all, they demand sacrifice. At this year’s Chinese New Year family reunion, a relative brought out a faded red book: my paternal grandmother’s family tree, dating back to the fourteenth century. Supplemented by even older records, the book documents a hundred and fifty generations. I try to wrap my head around that number; it feels as distant as an old wives’ tale. I imagine one of my distant kin toiling away in China, tracking down the clan that left for Singapore. Is this what it feels like to know that someone is watching over you? With each new generation a new record begins. Is this ritual? Or sacrifice? A life’s work, reaching across the Nanyang. The genealogy is necessarily incomplete: there are children given up for adoption, lost cousins, estranged sons. My name will never appear in the records; the family line only follows the sons. And yet, I feel the same pull. Perhaps it is the old Confucian value of xiao: filial piety. Piety. See how duty to one’s family is venerated, consecrated in the language of worship. It is, after all, only another kind of ritual, another kind of tradition – fighting against the flow of history and the wanderings of its adherents simply to survive. I feel it in the currents, far away from the source. I am being called to remember my roots.        by Elizabeth Spenst  “Now since it is 6:10 in Brazil, most of my childhood friends would be here,” Daniel Lucas Alves da Silva tells me as we stare at a wall facing a street lined with trees on Google Maps Street View. People are getting off work and grabbing a coke to drink at the corner with the friends they have known all their lives. “My friends might be here too, sitting exactly here,” Daniel said. He has clicked a few blocks away, and is now zooming in on a yellow lawn chair on a street corner. These friends are not with him thousands of miles away at gay bars in New Haven or at marches for Black lives. Instead these lifelong friends are sitting under a warm Brazilian sun and chatting about life, soccer, and women. Daniel clicks the mouse, and the screen zooms out. Daniel is a 28-year-old from San Jose do Rio Preto. He is teaching Brazilian Portuguese at Yale for a year as a Fulbright Language Teaching Assistant. Our tour of Rio Preto on Google Maps brought up images of flowers that bloom in Brazil’s winter. Daniel looked ruefully out the window towards the icy New Haven streets below and winds that prompted him to dryly ask me if it was a hurricane. If Daniel were passing you on a crowded street, you would probably notice. His deliberate, graceful stride makes his head tilt slightly from side to side like a model on a runway. His tightly coiled hair twists in little natural plaits down to the tops of his shoulders, and the sides of his head are shaved with his mane of hair flopping to one side. Every outfit is well coordinated and accentuated by layers or a statement accessory. Daniel tells me that he couldn’t wear layers in Brazil because it would be too hot. What he does in the US is impossible for him to do at home, and what he has accomplished at home is also considered an impossibility. “Black Brazilian people don’t travel, let alone travel to the United States, let alone travel to study, let alone are here at a university like this, let alone teaching,” he says with a laugh that exposes his wide teeth. Daniel is in a place of limbo where education has moved him to the middle class. The more he moves up, the more he must reconcile his Blackness, which he loves, with a home country that does not love it. The Portuguese Department at Yale is small, yet he is the only Black person in the department. Daniel tells me that when he meets other Brazilian people in the United States, they tend to do a double take and ask him if he’s Brazilian. They are all white, of course. He says that a lot of white Brazilian men are surprised when they encounter discrimination for the first time in the United States because of their position as “foreigner.” As a Black Brazilian, Daniel is not as surprised. “Welcome to my world. Welcome to America again, by the way,” Daniel laughs. As opposed to America’s “one drop” rule, Brazil operates as a pigmentocracy where hierarchy is determined by skin tone. “White people” include people from Asia and the Middle East. The point is to be anything but Black, so people can classify themselves in shades of brown instead of claiming “Black.” Daniel grew out his long, natural hair as a statement about his Blackness. He started the process when he was studying abroad at college in Spain. There he was out of sight of the country that would tell him that it was “cabelo ruim,” or bad hair. Daniel credits his mother, Rute, for instilling a sense of pride in being Black from a young age. Daniel always smiles when he talks about his mother, and he describes her as outspoken and assertive. She has worked as a maid all of her life, and Daniel remembers that she always moved on from an employer if she sensed mistreatment. Rute had Daniel 15 years after she had Renato, his 41-year-old brother who functions as an uncle in his life. Renato is a musician who plays samba and also works as a truck driver. Daniel, Rute, and Renato live together in a house in Rio Preto with a mango tree and a papaya tree in the front yard. Daniel’s father, Osvaldo, lives about 20 minutes away in Rio Preto. Daniel has never been to his house. Osvaldo works as an independent welder, and he has always been distant from his son. “I don’t think you can miss something you never had in the first place,” Daniel says. He counts his mother as such an active and powerful presence in his life that he never really mourned the absence of his father. Daniel tells me that his mother is very, very smart. She won the award for being the best student in her whole elementary school, and the prize was a radio. Daniel describes getting a radio in the 60’s in Brazil as equivalent to getting a Macbook now. Rute stopped going to school the year that the military dictatorship took over Brazil – 1964. She was in 4th grade. Even though his mother lived through the regime, Daniel says that he is more knowledgeable about the time period. Daniel describes this as a “lack of information caused by a lack of education.” Rute and Daniel grew up in very different Brazils, but Daniel’s experience is still very far from the norm. “I think that the most salient factor that comes into play in my saying that I am middle class now is education. And that is precisely what sets me apart from most of my fellow Black countrymen in Brazil,” Daniel tells me. Daniel is an anomaly, or maybe he is on the front end of a new wave of Black Brazilians having to become the representation that they do not see. “Brazil is changing a lot, Daniel said. “Twenty years ago nobody would say it was possible for me to be here as I am now. People would not even dream of it. No. That was a long shot, if it was a shot. Now it’s feasible. I’m not a hologram. I’m here and happy.”        by Karen Marks The music fades out and the lights of the Calhoun Cabaret rise on Teresa Chen ’19. She looks at the audience, and says, “I’m tired of writing about race. Her voice is steady, and even when it rises and falls with the emotion of her verses, she is in control of her captive audience. And just like that, the tone is set for Jook Songs’ spring show wax//wane.  On April 2nd , a line of mostly students of color had formed in the Calhoun basement, eager to watch a performance by Yale’s oldest spoken word group. Jook Songs reclaims the term jook sing used to describe Chinese Americans. However, the group includes a range of Asian students, whether American-born, international, or fifth-generation. Poets performed their five to seven minutes long pieces, exploring everything from race identity in America to romantic love, familial ties, and –as Teresa recited—“things white people write about.” Skyler Chin ’19 reflected on the conflict over others denying his American nationality. In this vein, Teresa talked about her struggles of wanting to be a writer who was Asian, rather than an Asian writer barred from writing about anything else but her race and culture. Claire Sheen ’19 addressed the problem with white writers using Chinese pen-names to qualify their work, disregarding the shame Chinese-Americans themselves were subjected to for using Chinese names. This poem, titled “Yellow Bodies,” not only captured the contradictions of Chinese names only being worthy when attached to white men, but also lack of recognition for Chinese-American laborers in American history, and Chinese contributors to Yale. Sheen particularly focused on Maya Lin, the designer of the Women’s Table on Yale’s Cross Campus, though better known for her design of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. Meanwhile, Kit Lea Cheang ’19 took a break from “poetic confession” and discourse, and chose to focus on positivity and possibility. In a low demure voice, Kit Lea listed all the things that one could accomplish without limits – attaching a foam middle finger to her head, and recommending vibrators to stressed-out peers, all while finding a wealthy and suitable husband at the end of the day. In each of the individual speeches at the end honoring an outgoing member, the love that Jook Songs fosters was felt as strongly as each poet’s recitations – deeply personal, public, and profound. Jook Songs’ wax // wane aptly captured the varying narratives and experiences of each poet, whether it was social justice commentary, mental illness, or the frustration of not having enough middle fingers to go around.        by Ryan Wilson Earlier this week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced plans to replace the image on the $20 bill of former genocidal maniac (and president), Andrew Jackson, with a portrait of Harriet Tubman. It was initially widely believed that Tubman would be completely replacing Jackson on the bill. It was later announced that Harriet Tubman, the legendary abolitionist, suffragist, and activist, would not have the bill all to herself, but would in fact be sharing the $20 with the slave-owning, genocidal, temperamental president. There are levels to this. America has a long history of turning Black bodies into cash. Over several centuries, millions of Africans found themselves stuffed into unsanitary and dehumanizing slave castles and factories for weeks to months on end. Chained, collared, and stacked together, many more of the enslaved would die during the trip across the Atlantic, their bodies tossed unceremoniously into the sea. Upon finally arriving at their destination in either the U.S., Caribbean, South America, or Europe, the enslaved would be traded or sold for cotton, gold, tobacco, sugar, rum or any number of goods. Black women in particular have always been vitally important to the creation of American wealth. The condition of the child always followed the mother, so the Black woman’s body was forced to become a tool to reproduce slavery. Every birth produced new property to grow the American economy. Every child became profit. Before her children were separated from her and sold away, it would not have been difficult for a Black woman to see her own face on a dollar bill. Harriet Tubman’s entire life was dedicated to fighting the effects of American capitalism. She was born property, and was forced to work and produce profit for her enslavers from a young age. In 1849, Tubman made her first attempt to escape her condition after she grew ill and discovered she was to be sold. For over a decade, Harriet Tubman would make more journeys back down South to rescue her family and dozens of other slaves from the fate of spending lifetimes as commodities and currency. In addition to being one of history’s most active abolitionist, Harriet Tubman was also a lifetime suffragist and activist. She spent her years advocating and fundraising for women’s suffrage, the disabled, the elderly, and the poor. Unfortunately, her constant fight for the rights and welfare of America’s most marginalized left her plagued by debt and financial troubles. Constantly working for the betterment of the conditions of Black people while simultaneously caring for those in need under her own roof left her impoverished throughout most of her life. Harriet Tubman died poor, plagued by the racist capitalistic system that had tried to consume her since her birth. Harriet Tubman spent a lifetime defying the dollar that aimed to define and devour her. Whether American capitalism aimed to own her through slavery or debt, Tubman stood against it at every turn. Now, we have decided that a fitting way to honor Tubman’s legacy and celebrate America’s “progress is to place her image on the symbol of the system that hunted her, and turn a former slave back into cash. This “honor” is as paper-thin as the material it’s printed on. We’ve put a Black woman on our currency, but the race and gender wage gap remains. If Harriet Tubman were alive today, on average she would be paid 64 percent of what her white male counterparts make. That means for every Tubman a white male pocketed, Harriet would take home about $12.80. Black women continue to be the most affected by the recent recession, yet are the demographic seeing the least recovery, with no improvement in unemployment reported by the National Women’s Law Center in 2014. Despite the fact that Black women lead in college enrollment over all other demographics, and Black women often display clear executive ambitions, they continue to be overrepresented in the 10 largest low-wage occupations in the U.S. such as waiters, childcare workers, and food preparation workers. Black women continue to provide the services necessary to the functioning of our schools, universities, businesses, and governments. All the while they continue to remain acutely at risk of state, domestic, and sexual violence. Black women continue to have high risk for health complications. Even over a century after Harriet Tubman died in poverty, many Black woman continue to be made vulnerable in their old age. Lifetimes of being overworked and underpaid result in “37 percent of black women over the age 65 [being] in households that rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income. This is compared to 29 percent of white women.”  Harriet Tubman’s biography, Bound for the Promised Land, tells an anecdote of how in 1897, Tubman was invited by white activists to several receptions in Boston being held in her honor. Harriet Tubman, unable to afford a train ticket, was forced to sell a cow in order to attend. The new $20 bill is a facade of inclusion. It aims to be an invitation to Black people, and Black women in particular, of acceptance into the American economy and American capitalism; but how do you invite someone to share a meal when the table is set on their own back? On one side of the bill will sit Harriet Tubman, her image representing the ideals of diversity and inclusion. On the underside will remain Andrew Jackson, representing the racist power structures that persist to the present day. The new bill only highlights how little things have changed. From slavery to segregation to private prisons to predatory lending, Black bodies have always been seen as currency. The difference between 3/5 and 64 percent does not leave much room for celebration.        by Arturo Pineda If an Internet user Googled “N**** House” in 2015, Google Maps directed them to the White House address. If someone searched “Black girls,” “Asian Girls,” or “Latina Girls” in 2011, the company’s algorithm produced pages of pornographic ads. Google classified both of these incidents as “glitches” in the algorithm. On April 10th at her lecture “The Intersectional Internet,” however, UCLA Information Studies professor Safiya Umoja argued that these “glitches” are not accidents at all. Umoja, whose research analyzes how algorithms perpetuate bias against marginalized communities, asserted that search engines are social constructs embedded with social, economic, and political views. In the previously mentioned search for women of color, the algorithm had been designed to associate women of color with pornography. That reflects the views of the people who developed the algorithm. Search engines like Google also favor the opinions of the popular, wealthy, and powerful. For example, Google features the results of their donors by listing them as sponsored and placing them at the top of search results. The search results include websites for the corporations Google invests in, and exclude competitors. Opinions with no monetary tie to Google will ultimately be buried in later pages. This design flaw is compounded by the amount of trust people place in technology. Approximately 70% of search engine users identify Google search results as being “reliable” or “trustworthy,” meaning Internet users trust the results provided by a skewed algorithm. Issues of bias extend to library database search engines as well. ARTSTORE is one of the largest databases for digitalized images of art and media. When Professor Umoja searched “Black stereotypes,” only 66 results appeared. When she searched “white history racism,” only 3 results did. The results highlight an ulterior purpose of technology: erasure. Based on this data, it would appear that white people are not racist, and that there are relatively few stereotypes of Black people. These search results showcase how algorithms can censor parts of history. Sometimes technological bias produces fatal effects. In 2015, Dylann Storm Roof—the white gunman who massacred 9 Black worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina—believed flawed information. His manifesto reads: “The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words black on White crime into Google […] There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders. I was in disbelief.” What if the results of the Google search had been different? What if the links had included scholarly articles explaining that the highest rates of murder occur within the same race? “In a society with more data and more injustice,” warns Professor Umoja, “it has become vital for all people to reject notions of neutrality in technology.”        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon When Wendy Red Star (Crow Nation of Montana) discovered the cheesy, flagrantly offensive 1980s “White Squaw” adventure-romance novels, she glanced at the cover art and knew she could do better. The Portland-based multimedia artist swapped the heroine’s face for her own. The result? A series of hilariously irreverent covers—this time featuring a real, live Native woman. On April 11th, Red Star appeared at the Native American Cultural Center to speak to a packed room about cultural pride, her tongue-in-cheek aesthetic, and indigenous art as resistance. Reclaiming agency for Native peoples is at the core of Red Star’s work. Her most recent installation, showing currently at the Portland Art Museum’s exhibit “Contemporary Native Photographers and the Edward Curtis Legacy,” takes aim at turn-of-the-century visual tropes depicting American Indians as a “vanishing race.” Red Star’s piece cuts Crow men’s faces out of vintage photographs—“to give them a break,” she says—and then presents the vacant cutouts alongside 1908 wax cylinder recordings of men singing their death songs. In her work, Crow speak for themselves. The installation also includes black and white photographs of Crow women in traditional dress, re-colored to restore the vibrant hues, and two-person portraits with her daughter Beatrice in tribute to the next generation of indigenous youth. Though the artist peppered her talk with lighthearted, intertribal teasing (“The Lakota are weird!”) and pithy anecdotes about her father’s all-Crow rock band (“White people had the Beatles, Crow people had the Maniacs”), even the most playful moments asserted an unbreakable connection between her identity, her art, and her project of reclamation and resistance. In the words of Katie McCleary ’18 (Crow/Little Shell Chippewa), president of the Association of Native Americans at Yale, Wendy Red Star “represents Apsáalooke [Crow] accurately in spaces where Native people are often misrepresented. Through her work, you can see the importance she places in helping and working with her community.” Wendy Red Star was invited to Yale at the request of Anya Montiel’s class “Native American Art.”        by Eshe Sherley Micah Jones and I are standing by a foldout table at Afro-American Cultural Center, better known as the House. She is the president of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, and I am her vice president and right-hand woman. We’re selling T-shirts to alumni at the House’s forty-fifth anniversary event. A woman, impeccably dressed, approaches us. She introduces herself as Bisa Williams. In 1975, six years after the House’s founding, Williams became the first Black woman president of BSAY since its founding in 1967. After Yale, she served as the Ambassador to Niger. As she talks to us, she looks over our last-minute display. She has an air of officiousness, but there is a warmth about her. She buys a shirt, but before she leaves, she says, “If I had to give you any advice, it would be to make sure you graduate on time.” She explains that before she became president, not a single one of her predecessors had graduated within four years. “I was determined for that not to be me. I was getting out in four years,” she tells us. “People will try to make you do everything, but you can’t let them.” Micah and I look at each other. Too late. For the past two years, I have interacted with the House not only as a leader and a member, but also as a historian. These roles can’t be separated—black protest and black scholarship have long gone hand in hand. Black activism at Yale gained global attention this past semester through the March of Resilience, when students of color reminded the campus of the ways in which Yale continues to fail them. And while the activism led to important advances, it did not erase past conflicts. In my research on the House, I’ve encountered repetitive cycles of conflict—not only between the Black student body and Yale, but also within its own community. Every BSAY board faces challenges, but the 2014–2015 board walked into an exceptionally difficult year. For four years, the Black community had been fractured under the leadership of Dean Rodney Cohen, the House’s top administrator at the time. Within months of his appointment in 2010, House managers wrote a letter to the Dean’s office about Cohen’s pattern of regularly missing staff meetings, not coming to student events, and failing to approve the undergraduate staff’s hours so that they could be paid. (Cohen could not be reached for comment for this story.) In the words of this staff in 2010, “Dean Cohens performance as Director of the House has been at best, lackluster, and at worst, appalling. He has presented a pattern of inconsistency, unreliability and lack of leadership that we havent experienced before, driving us to seek advice and guidance elsewhere.” When I arrived as a freshman in 2012, I saw these problems persist. I had entered into the midst of a debate that began with that letter, which in turn introduced me to alumni like Bisa Williams, who came back to the House in the fall of 2014. Their dismay at the disorganized state of the House community reopened a familiar wound. We had watched the Black student leaders before us struggle over what to do about Cohen’s tenure, and as a result, Micah and I made ousting Cohen a priority. The previous board produced a petition asking for Cohen to be “retrained” in the spring of 2014, but there was no response from Yale College administrators Dean Mary Miller, Dean of Student Affairs Marichal Gentry, or Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews. If administrators, two Black and one white, would not respond to communication from Black students, then it was time to stop asking and start demanding. The Yale we were contending with was no longer the gentleman’s club of the House’s founding years, but an unresponsive bureaucracy. Since its founding in 1969, Black activism has kept the House alive. Through the leadership of Armstead Robinson ’68, Don Ogilvie ’68, and Glen DeChabert ’70 (collectively known as “the Founders”), the House, then called Afro America Inc., was established at 1195 Chapel Street. By 1970, the House moved to 211 Park St., the former Chi Psi fraternity house, and was renovated in 1971. The BSAY board at the time had asked for a Black Cultural Center as a refuge from the pervasive whiteness of Yale life. Early in the 1969 spring term, BSAY sent President Kingman Brewster a letter demanding the founding of a BCC by September of the same year. The letter also reflected the many needs that Black students hoped the BCC would fulfill, including money for a part time coordinator of the center (approved by BSAY and the Afro American Study Group), a Black freshman counseling program, and help from the administration to obtain outside funding for social action. In September of 1969, Black students got their BCC. Soon, they would just call it “the House.” While winning Afro America Inc. and the African American Studies Department in 1969 were hard-fought victories, they inaugurated a battle over resources—necessary to allow the space to thrive—that would continue for decades. The University’s actions have historically starved the house of financial and human resources. Every year since its founding, the director has had to struggle to make sure the House and its many member groups have enough money to operate successfully. In the House’s early years in the nineteen-seventies, Black students attempted to transfer their Student Activities Fee from their residential colleges to the House, as they felt unwelcome at college parties, like one with a “Klan Party” theme in 1982. When the Student Activities Fee was reconfigured, the House had to start charging membership fees to Black students and even higher fees to students who came for individual events. Yale has also historically been stingy with resources for the physical structure of the House. In 1989, house Director Melvin Wade had to spend the beginning of the school year making sure that the University removed the last of the asbestos that had been partially dealt with in the summer. Even worse, according to Wade, the University had not brought the building up to code since 1928. Upon returning to Yale for the thirtieth anniversary of the House in 1999, the Black alumni were mortified by the state of the building that they had worked so hard to maintain. Dean Pamela George described her first impression when she walked into the space as its new director in 2000: “It was terrible. I cried. The rats, the roaches, praying that a roach didn’t come out while we were having an event—I hope I killed the last roach. The buckets, because the roof was leaking all over the place. It was horrible.” What happened to the roaches, the mice, and the leaking roof? The alumni got fed up. With George on board, they began a capital campaign to renovate the House. By the thirty-fifth anniversary celebration in 2004, the entire basement had been redone, an archive for the House had been established, and there was an endowment for Black student leadership development named the ORD Fund after the founders of the House: Ogilvie, Robinson, and DeChabert. But starting in 2010, at the beginning of Dean Cohen’s term, the gains reversed. The kitchen, like in 2000, became barely useable. A large rug in the main room covered a wooden floor that needed repair. The library, which used to boast countless books about Black history and culture, was nearly empty. More importantly, the House began to empty of people, as Black students saw the House as a less welcoming place. To make matters worse, the Yale administration decided to merge the “House directorship” position with an “assistant deanship” in the early nineteen-nineties, emphasizing the job’s connection to the Yale College Dean’s Office. This balancing act is not only taxing for the director, but also for the Black students who have to compete for the director’s time. Community building and direct interaction with Black students dropped on the list of priorities. George was one of the first directors who had to navigate the change. She commented on the risk of a director becoming isolated within the administration, away from the House and its members. “Before you know it,” she said, “something’s fallen apart.” While Micah and I organized under Dean Cohen, figures from the House’s past took notice. In the fall of 2014, the administration told all the cultural centers that they would receive external reviews. The ears of Black alumni, who had witnessed similar processes before, immediately pricked up. While the other directors of the three other cultural centers had notified their students about the review, Dean Cohen did not alert the House members. Upon hearing that Black students knew nothing of the University’s plans, alumna Kim Hershman ’88 sent House leaders an urgent email notifying them about the student forum portion of the review process. After the initial open forum in November, the administration had planned two more forums in early February 2015. Micah and I decided that one of these was the moment to publicly call for Cohen’s resignation. For several weeks, we went to groups in the Black community, urging them to sign the petition for Cohen’s removal. Not everyone did. Some students were afraid that a petition was too aggressive, and others didn’t feel compelled to say anything because they knew nothing about Cohen—which, we argued, was a reflection of his absence from the House. Ultimately, the Black Men’s Union rejected the petition, the only Black student group to do so out of the five that had connections to the majority of the House community. We decided to confront the rift head-on. Micah met with the President of the BMU, Will Searcy ’16, and he said he understood that Dean Cohen’s conduct, which to some appeared most invested in Yale’s Black men, harmed the community. In the petition, seven women had relayed experiences of sexism with Cohen. But the general body of the BMU still voted the motion down. Searcy said he saw rifts in attitudes toward the petition. When the BMU decided not to sign on, he said, it wasn’t out of disagreement with its organizational goals—the BMU agreed with wanting more financial transparency, clarifying the membership system, and setting up a structure to hold deans accountable. However, he said that the petition and accompanying letters against Cohen “didn’t always focus on problems with his effectiveness,” he said. “It was more of a character attack. Guys didn’t feel comfortable signing off on that because that wasn’t the experience they had with him.” From political decisions to social settings, gender issues in the Black student body have affected the House’s activism since its founding. At a Black Women’s Coalition meeting last spring, I heard an alumna talk about being raped by a Black male student in the nineteen-seventies. She felt she couldn’t talk about it because publicizing the story would undercut the Black student movement. How many other Black women before and after her had gone through the same experience? Sexism in the House often operates in activist spaces. From Bisa Williams to Caroline Jackson-Smith, who served on BSAY’s steering committee in the early seventies, women were often powerful, respected contributors to the activist work of Black Yale, but paternalism from male students could diminish their involvement. In 1974, Yale senior Warrington Hudlin made a documentary called “Black at Yale.” In one scene, three Black women argue with a Black male peer. They’re standing on the first floor of the House, filling the lobby with their dispute. It’s heated on both sides, but I noticed a hint of a smirk on the man’s face when I saw the film. He is so condescending, I thought, watching in the booth at the Yale Film Study Center. But maybe I’m just imagining it. Hudlin then cuts to the same Black man as he speaks to another Black male student in an apartment. The second Black male student comments on the three women—he understands “them” now. They’re “crazy,” but “you have to deal with them!” One of the women in the scene was Bisa Williams. When she took over BSAY in 1975, Williams wanted to transform the group’s “petty socializing and political romanticizing” into more disciplined political conduct. In a speech outlining these changes, Williams argued that BSAY should work to better “the mental, physical, social, and political condition of all people of African descent.” In line with that vision, she proposed fundamental changes in membership requirements for BSAY members. Upset that Williams seemed to be abdicating BSAY’s role as a social support for Black students, some members splintered off to form the Black Student Union (which ended in 1976). Williams told me she believes the split was due less to differing organizational goals and more to men finding female leadership hard to swallow. The complex tensions between men and women in the community haven’t gone away, and they often bubble to the surface during BSAY’s annual meetings on gender, which I’ve seen turn into shouting matches. At the beginning of our term in 2014, the BSAY board billed the year’s conversation as one about gender in the Black community, rather than at Yale in general, so that dialogue might feel less fraught. That day, people filled the Lighten Room in the basement of the House. More than twenty Black students pulled up chairs while chatting and formed a circle, music playing softly in the background. It felt normal. Then the meeting began. For an hour, only one of the many Black men in the room spoke. The rest sat, arms crossed, refusing to open their mouths. This was not abnormal. Union members often attended BSAY meetings in order to combat claims that BMU isolated itself from other House organizations, but they rarely contributed to meetings. This silence, however, felt different. Not disinterest, but disrespect. This meeting wasn’t about the BMU. It was about Black men and women trying to begin to heal an age-old impasse. But what does it mean when the men most resistant to engage with the rest of the community are primarily BMU members? Searcy, looking back at the meeting, said the men’s silence was not a BMU directive. Rather, he saw the meeting as “not an open dialogue.” He recalls feeling berated, and he said that his attendance was as a BSAY member rather than as a representative of the BMU. This was the environment in which we wrote the sixty-plus-page petition, which lacked the signatures of many black men. After its delivery at the open forum in February, we waited. Weeks later, in the midst of spring break, I found out that Dean Cohen had resigned. Just like that, it was over. On a March morning, I wake up to the sound of my phone. My room is dark. “Are you up?” It’s Micah. I’m late. “Sure I am.” I’m scrambling, searching for clothes, underwear, socks. Fuck. Several weeks after we found out Cohen had resigned, and yet things still seemed to be in shambles. I stop dead. I was supposed to wake up early and write a speech for the Unite Yale rally today, a direct action aimed at building power among the people involved in activism surrounding the neglect of the cultural centers, mental health reform, and divesting from fossil fuels. I won’t be delivering the speech—I’ve been replaced by Eli, a Black freshman and future vice president of BSAY, because we think my active presence might be counterproductive after my visibility in removing Cohen. Eli has a test today, so the task of writing her speech has fallen to me. Micah and I rush to the House. Sitting in the office, thinking about how to articulate the importance of our recent victory, I think again of Bisa Williams’s advice to make it out of Yale, to not do everything ourselves. I also think of Larry Irvin—a student who almost did not graduate. Irvin’s story begins in the spring semester of 1974, when the Yale Political Union invited William Shockley to debate Congress of Racial Equality President Roy Innis. By 1974, Shockley, a 1956 winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, had become a eugenicist and would speak on his belief that Black people were biologically inferior. As the day of the talk approached, the Third World Coalition, led by BSAY, distributed fliers about the protest. Several hundred students crowded outside that afternoon while a group of upperclassmen and coalition leaders went inside and shouted Shockley down. Yale gave thirteen “judicial penalties” for their participation. One was BSAY moderator Larry Irvin. Yale gave the students summer suspensions. With the immediate threat of Shockley’s inflammatory rhetoric gone, activist attention waned. When Irvin returned to school in the fall of 1974, he held several meetings in the House, but few people came. He struggled on through the semester, which prompted Yale to ask him to take the year off. When the new BSAY moderator, Bisa Williams, asked Irvin if he wanted the Black community to advocate on his behalf, he said no. Irvin finished his degree, but a year late. He was not the only casualty of Black student action whose academic trajectory was waylaid by the consequences of their activist work. Craig Foster ’73, a key Black leader, estimated in an archived interview that of ninety-six to one hundred Black seniors in his class, only fifty-five graduated. I do not know Irvin personally. I do not know where he is from, and most importantly, I do not know what happened to him after. But I understand him. Suddenly, I realize what the speech is about. I scrawl it out and speed walk from the House to the basement of Bingham where Eli is waiting. We’re assembled. Two-hundred and fifty Yale students on Cross Campus in front of Sterling Memorial Library—chanting, clapping, crying. Our hand-painted signs catch what little light peeks from behind the clouds. One by one, each speaker goes up, many asking their communities to come up with them. It’s Eli’s turn. She says: “Just recently, I found a photo of my Dad taken by my Mom while he was here—standing somewhere on Beinecke, speaking out in front of Woodbridge Hall. It’s students like him—who in the eighties were fighting for divestment from South Africa, […] that created a legacy so that current Black Yalies could win this semester. Their energy is here right now—the Craig Fosters, the Larry Irvins, the Sylvia Boones, the Glenn DeChaberts, my mother and father. The spirit that reminds us that, as Assata said best, ‘we have the duty to fight for our people and we have the duty to win.’” A friend of mine once told me that someone called the House a “spiritually dead place,” and I think they’re halfway right. The last five years of struggle stripped the House of its home-like feeling. Sometimes I wonder about what came out of our fight for the House. With the hiring of Dean Risë Nelson, and with the energy brought by the March of Resilience, we are beginning to rebuild. What is left are ghosts. The House may seem drained, but I can feel spirits in every part of the House. The founders, past directors, and the undergraduate selves of people like Irvin and Williams are all still living in this space. Some of them are there to drag us back into the worst parts of our collective pasts, preventing us from moving forward. Others are there to help us along the way. After a long absence, I happened to walk into the House before heading to a meeting. I walked downstairs, where I ran into a friend on the verge of a breakdown, sitting on the stairs and holding back tears. I put my meeting off; we talked while she cried. I couldn’t make it better, but I could sit with her. When we walked back to the hallway, she said, almost to herself, that I happened to show up right when she needed someone. It was like my energy, lingering in the space, had summoned me there. It was like I was already one of the ghosts. &nbsp; This piece was originally published in The New Journal        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon  I feel vaguely uncomfortable as I sit on a bright couch at La Casa one cold, sunny Saturday, waiting to go on the inaugural Social Justice Tour of Fair Haven with a handful of other students, a local alderman, and an activist. Even my excitement makes me uneasy. I’m wary of the tour’s presumption that I am connected to all Latinos before we’ve even met—that our census checkbox dissolves differences of history, language, race, citizenship, and class. I’ve never wanted to be divisive. Yet moments before we hop on the bus, I turn to Sebi, Amanda, and the others to confess a sentiment that has crystallized inside me since my arrival at Yale: this rosy rhetoric of unity is not my Latinidad. Before you call me Latina, I want you to know who I am. I am a mixed-race Black, white, South Asian, and possibly taína Indian woman born to two Caribbean parents. My brother is named Ismael after the legendary Puerto Rican salsero Ismael Rivera, and his Muslim name—along with my surname Padín, from Galicia, in Spain—reminds my family that cultural exchange and racial mixture was a fact of life in Iberia long before my ancestors were shipped to the New World. The history of colonialism in my family runs deep: my mother’s island switched hands between the French and British 17 times, and less than a decade after Americans snatched Puerto Rico from the Spanish, my great-grandfather Emiliano Padín graduated from the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania—enrolled as a member of the make-believe “Porto Rican tribe.” I grew up calling beans frijoles at my West Coast public school and the Caribbean word habichuelas at home, just as I code-switched between paleta and paico, helado and mantecado, or serpiente and culebra. I read García Márquez classics until I internalized a self-conscious, academic register of Spanish. It wasn’t until my second year at Yale—removed from Spanish class and closer than ever to Puerto Rico, or Borinquen—that I finally grew comfortable swallowing the last syllable of every word, blurring R’s and L’s, and treating S’s as optional, in easy imitation of the accents that fed me growing up and still sounded like warm honey. I identify most frequently as pan-Caribbean out of respect for both my parents and a desperate desire for shorthand to convey my Blackness, my curried fish, my French and Spanish, and my postcoloniality. After Caribbean, I say Boricua. It feels like erasure to call myself Latina first because the term is void of specificity. In cultural terms, a Latino is a racially ambiguous citizen of a country that doesn’t exist. Latinidad serves as a cover for the extreme inequalities and diverse experiences contained within our community. The term Latino—or Latinx—does not distinguish between a Miami-born white Cuban man and a mixed-race, undocumented Black indigenous Colombian woman. It doesn’t mention the politics of language that strain our community, or how difficult it can be to carve out legitimacy as queer Catholics, non-Christians, members of an African diaspora facing racism on two fronts, or even speakers of Portuguese. The cane-sugar-sweet rhetoric of pan-Latinidad pressures us to adopt decontextualized identities that undermine personal experience and intensify toxic politics of authenticity as we learn to covet Spanish, bachata, and mestizaje all at once. Most egregiously, it masks and sustains oppression along class, race, gender, documentation, and sexual orientation lines. Pan-Latinidad doesn’t work. But ironically enough, I found my alternative that Saturday in Fair Haven. In a way, the Social Justice Tour was exactly right—not because all Latinos have some common essence, but because our necessarily politicized solidarity and the friction, recognition of difference, and cross-cultural understanding that goes into constructing it are precisely what Latinidad is all about. We need to show up for each other not because we are one, but because even within our community, each of us is still Other. We need to put in the social and intellectual work to understand our prójimo, our vizinho, our neighbor—and organize to demand that Yale support us—because our bonds are born of joyful yet politically necessary and intentional love, not common experience. Possibly the only common knowledge we have is that essentialist tropes—all essentialist tropes—will ultimately fail us. My own experience tells me that Latinidad as a tool of anticolonial resistance can’t be based purely on indigenous claims to the land any more than it can be predicated on whiteness, because Afro-Latinos—just like African-Americans—are not originally of this soil. We were shipped to this “New World” with the colonizing white settlers. We have indeterminate roots. Latinidad is not easy. It’s not always loving. It’s not automatic. Our ability to organize and socialize around a common identity is a function of our commitment to letting different cultures and life experiences rub up against each other—sometimes painfully so. It’s our self-aware acknowledgements of difference, and our devout pledges of solidarity. Latinidad may be our birthright and a precious gift, but it’s not free. The Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata once famously said, “La tierra es de quien la trabaja,” or, “The land belongs to he who works it.” This may not be Mexico, and ours may not be that kind of revolution, but a similar principle still applies: just entitlement is an oxymoron. There is no community without work.        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon Between 3:30 and 5:00 pm at the Calhoun College buttery on Tuesday, April 26th, POC and indigenous students will welcome the admitted Class of 2020 and initiate Yale’s newest cohort into a culture of student activism. The event, publicized as “POC and Indigenous Turnout for the Turn Up: Building Student Power with the Class of 2020,” comes in the wake of November’s “Next Yale” campus demonstrations and anticipates upcoming verdicts from the Yale Corporation on discontinuing the title of residential college “master,” renaming Calhoun College, and naming the two new residential colleges. The program will feature music, dancing, postering, chants, ice cream, and a statement from Yuni Chang ’18, a member of the new Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration (RITM) Student Advisory Board and Intercultural Outreach Coordinator for the Asian American Studies Task Force (AASTF). “I hope [admitted POC students] will see that there is a community here for them that will support them and grow right at their side,” said Pierson sophomore Ivetty Estepan ’18, who will be House Staff at La Casa Cultural and a Peer Liaison at the Afro-American Cultural Center this coming year. “Maybe Yale isn’t where they want it to be right now, but they can work to change that.” Estepan is of Dominican descent. Several students cited increased collaboration between the Native American Cultural Center, La Casa Cultural, the Asian American Cultural Center, and the Afro-American Cultural Center since the events of Next Yale as a source of hope and strength moving forward. Noted Katie McCleary ’18, president of the Association of Native Americans at Yale, “Most of the events [ANAAY] did [this semester] were co-sponsoring or co-hosting events with other groups. We were reaching out to [them], but they were also reaching out to us, continuing the spirit of cooperation from last semester.” Added McCleary, “It’s just been awesome!” At the time of publishing, 110 students have committed to attending “Turnout for the Turn-Up” on Facebook. An additional 91 express interest. photo by Tasnim Elboute         by Eshe Sherley  On Wednesday evening, President Peter Salovey sent a campus-wide email announcing that the name of Calhoun College will remain, the title of “master” will be changed to “head of college,” and that the two new residential colleges will be named after Benjamin Franklin and Pauli Murray ’65 LAW. As the wise singer Lauryn Hill once said: It could all be so simple. But youd rather make it hard. Yale says that it respects civil dialogue. But these decisions reveal to us that what Yale really respects — power. This campus had a civil, well-researched, passionate dialogue about Calhoun College for months. The Yale Daily News reported that the average student on campus thought the name of the college should be changed. Surely, the Yale Corporation knew this, so why did they decide to keep the name? Yale is obsessed with its history, but only a certain version of it. The story goes that people like John C. Calhoun (or even Benjamin Franklin) are great men whose racism is just a blight on their pristine legacies. However, this is only partly true. Men like Calhoun were essential to the history of this country. But their racism is not just a stain; it was integral to the vision of the United States that people like him were working towards. Men like Calhoun built their wealth on the backs of Black people and from land that they stole from Native people. They further augmented that wealth with underpaid labor of Asian and Latinx people during different periods of United States history. It is this labor that also was used to literally build and sustain this university. But how do we square the recalcitrance on the issue of Calhoun College with the willingness to name one of the residential colleges after incomparable civil rights activist Murray and the change of the title “master” to “head?” These changes happened because the power marshaled by students forced Yale to respond. However, the University was also more willing to change because racist systems have always been willing to bend a little in order to contain dissent. A Pauli Murray College does the work of building a somewhat different Yale. That is a good thing. But in order to build a more racially just future we must also actively undo the racial wrongs of the past. Renaming Calhoun College would have begun that work. What Calhoun College continues to represent now are years of exclusion and racial injustice that are the bedrock of how Yale accumulated its wealth and built its foundations. The University leadership argues that keeping the name of Calhoun College allows them to teach about the complicated history of Yale. That is disingenuous at best. We do not need to hold onto the racist relics of our past to teach about them. We could teach the history of Calhoun College by putting a plaque on the wall of a newly renamed college. Or we could start by fostering an environment that is hospitable to the ethnic studies professors who have already been teaching this history for decades. Changing Calhoun College is not about history as it is something that is separate from the lived experience of people of color in the present. Dean Jonathan Holloway himself argues in his book “Jim Crow Wisdom” that the traumas of this past are still with us today — that they continue to live in the bodies and psyches of the subsequent generations of Black people. The students of this university gave Yale the opportunity to heal these original sins that haunt us to this day. But Yale refused. This intergenerational pain experienced by students of color, and especially Black students, is not rhetorical. It is real. This decision to retain the Calhoun name is already affecting students’ health and well-being. It is reminding us that Yale will never be a place where we can thrive as human beings and that it will always be a place that ultimately demoralizes students of color because the University does not care enough about our lives to change beyond the surface level. To let go of the name of Calhoun College is to symbolically alter the very roots of Yale College. It is to truly honor the spirit of the protests not only of last semester, but of the generations of marginalized students on this campus. Student activism last semester called on this university to become a better version of itself. But instead, the University decided to protect its racist foundations on the backs of people of color, as they have done for hundreds of years, even before Black students were allowed to enter this place as students. I never bought the lie that this place would be like home. But I did hope that just this once, Yale could value students over money and its racist past. I guess not. I guess this is the beginning of round two. This article was also published in the Yale Daily News        by Micah Jones  I call November 5th, 2015 “Dark Thursday.” I remember standing on Cross Campus with friends who have become family talking to Dean Holloway with tears and raindrops running in intermingling rivets down our faces. We told him that we needed more from him, from President Salovey, from this university, from our peers. We told them that being second class students at a first class university was not enough. On Wednesday, April 27th, we opened yet another email from the Yale administration letting us know how little they think we are worth. Pauli Murray College is a step in the right direction, but when paired with Benjamin Franklin College, when paired with the decision to keep Calhoun’s name, it is not enough. And I am tired. The events on this campus over the last four years are not isolated, but rather a part of a larger story of what students of color have experienced in our time here. It is all a part of one swelling tidal wave of racism that began washing over me in my senior year of high school with the death Trayvon Martin. In the summer of 2014, I watched as Eric Garner became horribly still in the embrace of the New York police. I saw the images of Michael Brown’s body frying on the asphalt in the midday sun. I saw the police invade Black neighborhoods rolling down the streets in tanks and wearing gas masks. On this very campus, a Yale student was held at gunpoint by the police. Yet, in asking that we not have to live in a college named after one of the foremost proponents of slavery as a positive good in American history, we are asking for too much. There comes a point, or maybe many points, in every student of racism’s life when they begin to truly understand the scale of the problem they are facing. What I have lost in my time here is the belief that racism and monuments that honor racists will be excised from this campus in my time here as a student or this nation within my lifetime. This loss of faith raises the question: why should I fight these battles if I may never win? Time and time again, I turn to the past in search of a legacy, a usable history that might offer insight into my present conundrum. I frequently return to the narrative of Myles Horton. Horton was a lifelong activist for racial and economic justice and founder of the Highlander Folk School which taught grassroots organizing. Horton published a book called The Long Haul. In The Long Haul, Horton uses a burning log fire as an extended metaphor about maintaining one’s passion for activism. He argued that in order to make it in the long-term an activist has to learn to keep the fire of their passion banked, but smoldering, and ready to flare up when needed. Given how deeply entrenched various systems of oppression were in American society, liberation was not going to end overnight but rather “the revolution had to be built step by step.” The Long Haul teaches us that we must take things day by day. This way we are not overwhelmed. We must remember the bigger picture – that racism affects every aspect of our lives both on and off campus, but we must not let it consume us. We must cherish the victories, and not let them be used to pacify us, but rather to remind us of our power. We must pace ourselves if we are going to be in it for the long haul. There are still days, like today, when being a Black woman on this campus curls me into the fetal position in the womb of my narrow twin bed. In these moments, I remember that this struggle is sacred. That I fight because I value myself and all of you people whom I love too much not to at least try. Every day that we take to our beds, and do not stay there, choose instead to be reborn, choose instead the struggle, choose instead to live on and fight on, we are victorious. To paraphrase Yale alumna Zora Howard in her poem “Sistergirlfriend,” we are a hundred miles deep, two thousand degrees, squeezed to bursting brilliance, we are a sharp darkness, we are a peeling stone, and we are more than enough.        by Erika Hairston with contributions from Yonas Takele  Native land and bodies, Black bodies, Latinx bodies, and Asian bodies have built the foundations of Yales campus. The greatest donation our forefathers and foremothers have given this place is their blood, sweat, and tears. The toll of these sacrifices is simply too high to count. I consider myself a quite logical person, but Yale had three chances to do better. I tried to write a response last night, but I was mentally paralyzed by the illogical and offensive statements released by my Universitys President. After receiving Peters email last night, I had approximately 7.5 minutes to celebrate a queer Black womanist and civil rights activist. As a queer woman of color, Pauli Murray embodies the tension between oppression and hope.  Every time a person speaks her name, they will be etching her into the fabric of this university forever. Nowhere on this campus has a tribute of this scale been constructed for a person of color. Nowhere on this campus do students of color see themselves so powerfully represented. A woman of color is finally being centered. I will no longer have to eat underneath the gaze or scowl of white portraits in a college dining hall. Pauli Murray, women of color, and my queer brothers and sisters, you are worthy of remembrance. But of course, I kept reading the email after doing my little dance for the bone they threw me. As my eyes continued scrolling, Yale Corporation quickly snatched the bone from my mouth, reminding me whats truly important and how useless their words are: Erasing Calhoun’s name from a much-beloved residential college risks masking this past, downplaying the lasting effects of slavery, and substituting a false and misleading narrative, albeit one that might allow us to feel complacent or, even, self-congratulatory. Retaining the name forces us to learn anew and confront one of the most disturbing aspects of Yale’s and our nation’s past. And then Salovey on Benjamin Franklin: In adopting his name for one of the new colleges, we honor as well the generosity of Charles B. Johnson ’54 B.A., who considers Franklin a personal role model. Mr. Johnson’s contribution to enable the construction of the new colleges is the single largest gift made to Yale. Reading these words, I cackled. These quotations display pure ignorance. The claim that erasing Calhoun’s name would lead to complacency completely erases the experiences of students of color on this campus. We have never been silent in the face of injustice and oppression. To make such a claim is baseless and offensive. With this decision, President Salovey continues Yale’s tradition of undermining the contributions of minority students. There is no room for students of color to be honored or made to feel at home. As this name reminds, students of color will be made to live inside their oppression. The burden will once again fall on us to educate. President Salovey, thank you for being a part of a legacy that haunts us. We will not let you or the rest of Yale forget the incalculable work people of color have done to better this institution. I decided to edit Peter’s paragraph: “Not erasing Calhoun’s name from a residential college risks painfully reminding students of color every day of the lasting effects of slavery, and supports a violent narrative tearing down Black and Brown bodies, allowing ignorant people to feel complacent, unmoved, or even self-congratulatory.” Those are the words I should’ve read. Though Yale has reminded us where their true priorities stand, I will make time to rejoice Murray. We Out Here. Say it again, but think of the land you stand on. Think of a person of color whose ancestors have bled for a place that has only stolen. Think of yourself and your place in a white supremacist and capitalist ruling nation. Who is the “We” these words are affirming? Who is centered in this space? We Out Here.        by J. Ery Díaz “Listen, dear, I realize that you’ve been hurt deeply because I have been there,” drawls Aretha Franklin at the start of “A Rose Is Still a Rose.” The titular track in her 1998 album, released through Arista after a long hiatus, is a tremendously slick piece of R;B—Franklin’s showstopping vocal potency, enhanced by its rich warmth, grooves glossily with Ms. Lauryn Hill’s bright contralto. Amidst swaying violins, Franklin offers identity advice to her younger counterpart, sharing the knowledge accumulated through years of being wronged: “’Cause a rose is still a rose / Baby girl, you’re still a flower / He can’t lead you and then take you / Make you and then break you / Darlin’ you hold the power.” The lyrics to “A Rose Is Still a Rose” read today like a manifesto of symbolic correction, the rebranding of self as a way to exert some agency over unfortunate circumstances. And what is more unfortunate today than the piecemeal decision to name one of the new residential colleges after Pauli Murray, a powerhouse as driven as Franklin’s voice, while naming the other after the unaffiliated Benjamin Franklin of all people? “We honor as well the generosity of Charles B. Johnson ’54 B.A., who considers Franklin a personal role model,” wrote Peter Salovey, showing that half measures can make excellent decisions seem more craven, more calculated. Yale understands that a name can be powerful, so we get Murray, but it firmly believes that a name is still a name, so we get Franklin. A name is profoundly influential, so we get to keep John C. Calhoun as an open wound, a reminder of “one of the most disturbing aspects of Yale’s and our nation’s past.” His legacy is too raw to obfuscate and will stop the institution, according to Salovey, from becoming complacent and wildly revisionist. But a name is still just a name, so Benjamin Franklin is subjected to a revisionist narrative where he has more than tenuous ties to Yale University, where he becomes a founding symbol despite founding, quite literally, the University of Pennsylvania. But a rose is still a rose is still a flower. And in the face of an absurdly empty decision by the least transparent and accountable figure in the university—the Yale Corporation—Yale students hold the intellectual toolbox to construct something meaningful in the name of Franklin College. If Salovey is tacitly admitting that symbols are all-enduring yet fluid, the community can intervene to wrest control of the latent meaning from a signifier that is unlikely to be changed. This is happening already. The stenciled portrait of a regal Aretha Franklin covers corkboards across campus. “FRANKLIN COLLEGE: We Deserve R-E-S-P-E-C-T”, it states. On social media, students are changing their profile pictures to the same blue image of Aretha Franklin singing into a microphone. They post photos of Aretha Franklin next to Peter Salovey, superimposed over $100 bills. Outside of the Women’s Center, a giant banner reads “WE OUT HERE. WE’VE BEEN HERE. WE AIN’T LEAVING. WE ARE LOVED”. To its right, the portrait of Aretha Franklin, who holds an Honorary Degree from Yale, seems to heighten the message: “Baby girl, you hold the power.” Although Benjamin Franklin means many things to many people, most regrettably to Charles B. Johnson, Aretha Franklin has the gift of a voice that we can actually hear. In its belting power, in its range and projection, it is able to send anyone into passionate frisson in the way that only the most talented singers can. After Aretha and Lauryn Hill released “A Rose Is Still a Rose,” the resulting chart performance and critical acclaim reinvigorated Franklin’s career. So we must remember that a rose is still a rose is still a flower. Let’s repeat until the image of the diva fills up an empty name: Franklin College. Franklin College. Franklin College. Photo by J. Ery Díaz &nbsp;        by Ana Barros To the Op-Eds I will read in the morning: I know there’s very little I can say that will make you understand. There are not enough tears, not enough poems, not enough instruments in the world to speak the language of my stomach on nights like this one. How do you describe betrayal and disappointment with just your fingertips? We are limited in our communication because we stand worlds apart, but are forced to analyze each other as if we were face to face. But in our writing, we are searching for the same things. You want to understand how my emotions fit into a broader narrative. I want that too. I’m still waiting for someone to open up the space for my emotions to fit into a broader narrative. I’m waiting for there to be room for my tears and my pain without my having to present a pile of notarized receipts, “intellectual” arguments and statistics and to justify them. You see, the evidence you’re searching for — of coddling or suppression of free speech or radicalization — is too small of a box to fit everything I’m trying to tell you. There is no time to worry about covering all my bases when I’m singing or crying or writing because doing so would take hundreds of years of a history I have already experienced in a mere twenty. To the comments section of this Op-Ed: I know you. I know what you want. You want to find the hypocrisy in my words; the inconsistencies and the hyperboles in my argument. You want to dig up my feelings and deconstruct them until they are yours to tell. It’s okay. I want you to share my feelings. That’s all I’ve wanted this entire time. Take them. Please. Take my exhaustion and resuscitate it. Sit in Battell Chapel in November and then sit in it again in April and feel the inertia of this world you were told you could change with your mind. Feel your heart reach out of your chest and envelop your friend in a bulletproof vest as she tells her leaders they have failed her. Feel the weight of that failure. Tell yourself you are loved because you are. Comments Section, we’re one and the same. We’re both trying to understand. When I speak in hyperboles, it’s because there is no vocabulary that encapsulates the size of my feelings. What is the word for being simultaneously too big and too small? What’s the word for being at once confident and crippled by doubt?  I’m collecting phrases as I navigate this, as I’m sure you are. We’re at two radically different stages of this process, and the cognitive dissonance is as divisive as the subject we’re attempting to deal with. But I’m collecting emotions as well. I’m learning to be angry. Sometimes I struggle to sculpt that anger into a product that is communicable, but isn’t that the point of dialogue? And art? This is a part of me that I have kept under a very beautiful blanket for many years, untouched and undiscovered. Give me some time to try on my new voice and maybe I will tell you my story. To the Op-Eds I will read in the morning: You don’t scare me. I’ve had my practice round. In November I was still trying to find compromise; still trying to own the burden of that sweet spot between honest anger and perfect restraint that you asked of me. But it’s spring now, and I’m not covering myself up anymore. I’ve told you who I am. I’ve shown you the kinetic energy that my heart contains. And I’ve demonstrated the immensity of my empathy and my patience. Now it’s time for you to listen. I’m standing on the shoulders of the bravest women that history has never seen. I just hope you have a pen handy because when we open up our hearts. It’s going to be a masterpiece.        by Karen Marks Earlier this semester, Nick Aramayo ’17 (they/them/theirs), filmed a video explaining why it’s important to specify gender pronouns in classroom introductions. The video became so popular that Aramayo started a video series called “Just Ask the Question” (JAQ) to provide more opportunities for cisgender* students at Yale to become educated allies of the trans community. For JAQ, Aramayo receives questions by Facebook message that cisgender people may not be comfortable asking publicly, and answers them in a video response. Askers remain anonymous to viewers. If Aramayo feels the question is inappropriate, they explain why, and refer askers to other resources. As a trans Latinx student, Aramayo aims to open up discussions of gender and sexuality to include dialogue around class and race in ways absent from the privileged, white LGBTQ discussion space that predominates at Yale. As a Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies major, Aramayo researches Latin American gender queerness, learning about an indigenous Mexican third gender called the muxes, Venezuelan “pageant queens,” and the Brazilian travesties who often perform as women and get feminine medical enhancements, but don’t necessarily identify as women. These groups are often translated incorrectly into Western queer culture. “When they give statistics on trans women being murdered in Brazil,” says Aramayo, “I wonder: how many of those are trans women, and how many are travesties?” As a speaker of Spanish, Aramayo has had to reconcile their trans experience with a language that lacks gender-neutral pronouns. Ultimately, they decided that masculine pronouns best reflected their trans-masculine, non-binary identity. This is not Aramayo’s first involvement with trans life at Yale. This summer, they created In the Qloset, a clothing donation program for trans students at Yale in need of new clothes that fit their gender expression. Clothing swap events provide members of the trans community with free clothes and a space to socialize in a primarily cis world. Still, Aramayo hopes that viewers of their series understand that they are not the final say in trans issues. “There are just as many ways to be trans as there are trans people in the world,” Aramayo says. There are currently five episodes of “Just Ask the Question” on Aramayo’s channel. &nbsp; *“Cisgender” refers to people who identify as their gender assigned at birth.        by Alejandra Padín-Dujon This speech was given at the renaming ceremony for the college formerly known as Calhoun on April 29, 2016.  This is the part of any Yale event where we would usually thank our donors. We’d thank the people whose sacrifice and generosity have given us the bittersweet privilege of studying at this university—of standing right here today, together, on Cross Campus. At his speech yesterday in Battell Chapel, President Salovey pointed out that alumni donations to the tune of Charlie’s 250 million dollars help fund our education. But the problem is, we know why we’re here. And it’s not because we are beholden to corporate masters, past or present. You and I know that we survive and prosper because we are loved. We are here because our parents loved us. They made countless sacrifices, worked countless hours, and drew strength from the past while planning for our future. We are here because our ancestors fought genocide, exploitation, murder, terror, and white liberalism. We are here because even before we were born, they loved us. We are here because of a long, glorious tradition of POC and allied student activism that we celebrated last semester, and that the university can never be allowed to forget. We are here because our forbears carved out physical spaces for us in the form of the four cultural centers, because our Peer Liaisons fed us pan dulce, scallion pancakes, black-eyed peas, and blue corn mush. We are here because when we cried, our communities offered their shoulder, and because when we were happy, they danced with us, in our language, to our music. We are here because we can trace our lineage back through generations of Yale students of color who paved the way for our arrival. Today, tomorrow, and forever, we honor their legacy and continue their good work. Finally, we are here because centuries ago, English settlers led by the Reverend John Davenport occupied the lands of the Quinnipiac and other Algonquian-speaking peoples. We are here because Elihu Yale profited shamelessly off of the British colonial project in India, and because many of our ancestors were enslaved to benefit and bring fame to the likes of John C. Calhoun. We are here and fed and provided for because of the labor of countless Black and brown residents of the City of New Haven, where Yale University is the single largest employer, and where our institution engages in a settler colonial project of its own. In short, we are here because of historical and ongoing injustice. It’s the perfume in the air that all Yale students breathe, and it is our motivation to fight back—to make things better—with the force of our own radical love. President Salovey, alumni, Yale Corporation—we are grateful people. We are not selfish. We are painfully self-aware. But our gratitude and allegiance belong to those who love us, and to those whose sacrifice truly built this university. It does not belong to you.        by Yuni Chang This poem was performed at the Calhoun Renaming Ceremony on April 29, 2016 adjusted in response to the decisions made on wednesday: &nbsp; photo by Alex Zhang         by Karléh Wilson On Saturday, April 31st around 8 pm, Black New Haven resident Jeffrey Agnew went to Boss Liquor on Whalley Avenue with a female friend to buy alcohol. They intended to use the friend’s debit card for the transaction. A security guard immediately warned them that using someone else’s credit card is illegal—which they already knew, and never intended. Agnew attempted to explain himself, but the conversation escalated. The store owner called the police, so Agnew and his friend decided to leave the liquor store without purchasing alcohol. By the time they left, the police were on their way. The police pulled up just as they reached their car. Agnew reports that a police officer—one of nine who arrived on scene—asked him to step forward, which he did while attempting to explain the situation. The officer maced Agnew, who continued trying to explain himself. At this point, the officer began to beat Jeff with billy clubs. Jeff was immediately knocked unconscious. He remembers waking up briefly with his face in the road, burning, and then coming to in the hospital, where he was handcuffed to the bed and prevented from speaking to his mother. He reports that the officers repeatedly lied to him about where he was and made him feel unsafe. Officers arrested Agnew’s friend Tyeisha Hellams after she attempted to help him off the ground during the beating. Hellams recorded video of the violence on her cell phone. The video is in custody of community activist group Black Lives Matter New Haven and has yet to be released. Hellams and Agnew were arrested and taken to jail under charges of misdemeanor and disorderly conduct. Both have $5,000 bail bonds. Both are members of the queer community in New Haven. Black Lives Matter New Haven is currently coordinating a response, and welcomes support from Yale students. An open strategy meeting will be held today, May 2nd, at the People’s Center on 37 Howe Street (near Mamoun’s) at 7 pm.

In the other corner, weighed down by a shit ton of student loans, we have the resilient / frustrated / powerful Yale POC students and allies asking for some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. 4:21pm Students come out swinging. Money raining down and monopoly boards up to reflect the driving force of the decision. Duct tapes on mouths because we know this isnt really a discussion but another town hall style meeting to try to calm students and to give an illusion of discussion / compromise. Salovey weakly returns with a half ass justification of the decision, that he probably doesnt even fully agree with. Says he doesnt like slippery slope arguments, then continues to use slippery slope argument. 4:24pm Students say they cant respect an administration that doesnt respect them. Salovey admits that in an epic edition of misheard lyrics, he thought Aretha sang D-I-S-R-E-S-P-E-C-T. 4:29pm Students continue to rain down money feat. our good friend Barry. ‪#‎ObamaCollege Salovey says we should be appreciative / content that so much of our education is paid for. Affirms it is all about the Benjamins. Doesnt comment on the number of summer homes former President Rick Levin owns. 4:35pm Pete brings up Ben Franklins good works and why it was Charlies choice, like that kite experiment. Students point out that though Benjamin Franklin talked the talk on his deathbed, he most definitely did not walk the walk. 4:42pm Salovey reasserts hes flawed logic that keeping the names forces us all to address history of slavery. Students point out that greatest donation to Yale is the unpaid labor of slaves. And on that note, ask admin, in an Oprah Winfrey style of fashion, to check under their seats bc theyre currently sitting on the ancestral homelands of the Quinnipiac people. Reiterate that addressing history doesnt mean traumatizing POC students and making experiences at Yale more painful. 4:45pm Students pull up Wikipedia and tell Peter that SLAVERY DID INDEED EXIST. Ask who admin is trying to teach when keeping the name and why they just wont do what we asked last semester and require an ethnic studies class. 4:57pm Students restate the NextYale demands. Bc their further implication wouldve let us avoid this present shitshow. Point out that black students and POC students live being black and POC. Dont have to read about being black and POC or have to be taught to address it. At this point, Jonathan Holloway has said nothing. He holds a copy of his book on Jim Crow Wisdom in his hand. Flips through it to seek counsel. He seems unsure what book students are referencing.  5:05pm Students ask where is the justice for Jer**** and other harassed students after last semester as they were dragged through the media and told that they are coddled. Salovey says Marta coddles him every night and he enjoys it. But understands that isnt everyones experience. Doesnt bring up that he helped Christakis come to Yale Psych Department. 5:10pm Students bring up history of the chapel we currently sit in as a Civil War memorial. Peter says he didnt know but enjoys the fun fact. Doesnt follow logic and how it relates to the false justification of keeping Calhoun. 5:23pm Students walk out, raining the rest of the money and singing We Dont Mind. Kim and Peter thank us as we walk out like we just politely left a fancy dinner party, where race / politics / abortion / religion were most certainly not brought up. Students pick up money as they walk out cause they know that if we dont, Yale will make the all black cleaning staff do it. &nbsp; photo courtesy of Alex Zhang         by Ellie Pritchett and Karen Marks On April 29th at 3 pm, Yale students of color held a renaming ceremony for Calhoun College on Cross Campus. The ceremony, attended by approximately 600 people, rechristened the residential college provisionally as “the college formerly known as Calhoun.” It did not specify a new name. The renaming comes in the wake of President Salovey’s Wednesday email announcing the Yale Corporation’s refusal to rename the college, and Thursday’s town hall meeting at Battell Chapel in which students criticized what they viewed as the sale of the residential college name to the highest bidder—in this case, Charles Johnson ’54, whose $250 million donation towards the construction of the colleges is the largest single gift in Yale’s history. As speaker Naiya Speight-Leggett CC ’19 stated in her opening remarks, removing John C. Calhoun’s name gives students the freedom to reclaim the college they call home and to consider a Yale that does not glorify white supremacy. Each student demonstrator was given a picket sign bearing the Calhoun crest and one of several alternative names, including Silvia Rivera, Don Nakanishi, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Henry Roe Cloud. At exactly 3 o’clock, students holding pickets filed into lines on the grass outside the college, standing silently before hundreds of students and dozens of cameras. Afterwards, Calhoun College students of color filed out with larger signs, occupying the front row. The ceremony featured spoken word poetry by Yuni Chang MC ’18, a Pueblo Indian blessing from Charelle Brown ES ’19, and a rendition of “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” performed by Dianne Lake ES ‘16 and Anita Norman BK ‘19 of Shades. Where a traditional Yale naming ceremony would have honored monetary donors, speaker Alejandra Padin-Dujon DC ’18 emphasized that students of color are not “beholden to corporate masters, past or present” and that “we survive and prosper because we are loved.” Speeches given therefore honored parents, unpaid laborers, and activists of Yale’s history. “Today’s demonstration exemplified the tireless collective labor that students of color have put into making Yale a more just space,” said organizer and demonstrator Crystal Kong BK ’18.  While Lake and Norman sang “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” Calhoun College students hammered their pickets into the ground. Other students then joined in singing and laid their pickets on the ground. Ashia Ajani TD ’19 offered final remarks and Ivetty Estepan PC ’18 cut an orange ribbon to close the ceremony. Afterwards, demonstrators held hands and filed out from Cross Campus, past Woodbridge Hall. There, they sang a rousing chorus of last semester’s activist anthem “We Don’t Mind” followed by a joyful chant of, “We out here! We been here! We ain’t leavin! We are loved!” Students returned to Cross Campus to hammer remaining crests into the grass and dance outside the gates of the college formerly known as Calhoun. As organizer and demonstrator Desmond Amuh BR ’18 said, “It was spiritual. It was healing. The Renaming Ceremony that took place on Cross Campus today demonstrated the resilience of the community in the face of adversity.”  photos by Elizabeth Miles  In deference to the Calhoun Renaming Ceremony, DOWN Magazine will refer to the college “formerly known as Calhoun” by the abbreviations “FKA Calhoun College” or “FKACC” until the college can be assigned a new name by popular consent.        by Dhikshitha Balaji It is clear that the Yale English Department’s major for undergraduates must be restructured. A few weeks ago, Adriana Miele published an article in the Yale Daily News observing that “the department educates its students in venerating the English canon” and thus “actively contributes to the erasure of history.” As a sophomore English major just beginning to navigate this department, I have already faced the issues Miele writes about and identify deeply with her message. It is entirely possible, as Miele writes, “to graduate with a degree in English Language ; Literature by reading exclusively the works of (mostly wealthy) white men.” In fact, I have found that it takes conscious effort not to do so. The combination of the prerequisites, the notoriously antiquated Major English Poets sequence, and distributional requirements severely limits our ability to tailor the major to be more inclusive. The undergraduate student must work around the department rather than with it to read authors with a diversity of identities. Miele states that the department “needs an existential makeover,” even quoting Claire Vaye Watkins, a critic of overt masculinity in contemporary American literature, to say “Let’s burn this motherf***ing system to the ground and build something together.” I’m not sure if it needs such a total torching. The department seems to be trying to keep up with, or rather can no longer avoid, demands for a diverse education. After all, it offers upper-level courses such as “Race and Gender in American Literature,” “Asian American Literature,” “Postcolonial Literature,” “Feminist ; Queer Theory,” and “African American Poets: Modern Era.” So where does the disparity between the disappointing experience of the student and the attempts of the department to provide a broad education arise? One reason may be that the number of the kinds of courses that students like Miele and I are demanding are relatively low, especially at lower levels, compared to the courses that are traditionally associated with the department, such as “Milton” or “Romantic Poetry.” The existence of classes like Race and Gender in American Literature cannot be attributed solely to the English Department, as most of these classes are cross-listed with other departments such as American Studies, African American Studies, Womens, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Ethnicity, Race and Migration. This leads me to ask how much initiative the department has taken on its own to introduce more inclusive classes and whether there are enough people in the English department qualified to teach these courses. Ultimately, the discrepancy is fueled by the structure of the major, which heavily emphasizes the permanence and prominence of the Western English canon. Most immediately, the department’s preservation of the introductory Major English Poets sequence is inexcusable. Why does the department perpetuate the idea that an introduction to the basis of English literature can be imparted through a disjointed study of eight white male poets? The experience of taking this painful introductory sequence will color the remainder of my journey through the major, since the department has already implicitly asserted which voices it believes deserve to be considered and which voices can be left out without consequence. The English Department has created a culture in which students who have historically been underrepresented and silenced still do not feel welcome because of the design of its undergraduate program of study. I joined the Yale English Department because I wanted to join a tradition of people who speak, read and write clearly and effectively; not because I wanted to propagate the very specific tradition of the student this department has historically allowed to thrive. I also joined the Yale English Department because it needs me and people like me. By redesigning a course of study that more accurately reflects the students within the major, the department can keep itself from becoming anachronistic and fossilized. It can do this by replacing the Major English poets sequence, introducing more diverse options for the pre-1800 and pre-1900 requirements, and opening up a dialogue with current majors about how best to represent them.        by Carlene Ervin I didn’t know that private schools existed. Within my sphere of knowledge in Oakland, CA of public and charter schools battling for state funding, private schools were a dreamland. For all I knew private schools were Hollywood’s inventions in order to sell the stories of rich kids’ childhood drama. Where I’m from, some schools had trouble providing desks for all the enrolled students. It was unfathomable that in this country there exist high schools that have seminar-style classrooms with only 12 students who sit at circular tables, engaged in “intellectual” conversations. When I was admitted into Yale, I saw that seminars not only existed but were emphasized in Yale’s learning culture. My first interaction with seminars came before the start of my freshman year. I was invited to participate in the Freshman Scholars at Yale (FSY) program, which offered English 114 as class to help students academically transition to Yale. When I learned that English 114 was seminar style I almost backed out of participating because I had never been in a situation where students’ voices were so central to the learning environment. Looking back, I now realize that FSY couldn’t paint the full picture of what Yale would be like. Most students in FSY had similar experiences with race, poverty, and attending public schools. We brought those experiences to the classroom and often validated and understood each others’ experience. I was nervous when a lot of upperclassmen told me that the best classes at Yale were seminars, and even more stressed when I found out that all lectures had discussion sections. Instead of having a professor teach new information, sections are entirely based on peer to peer learning and the entire time is devoted to student discussion. I would walk into a seminar and there would be twelve students sitting around a large oval table. Six students would be white men, two would be Black men, one would be a white woman, one would be an Asian woman, and I would be the lone Black woman. According to a Yale Daily News survey of the Class of 2018, about 50% of students went to private high schools and 3 of 5 students paid over $20,000 a year for their high school education. I soon found that these racial and economic demographics were barriers that prevent me from fully participating in classroom discussions. In some small classrooms I thrived. In my English 120 (Reading and Writing the Modern Essay) seminar I was the person who expressed the unpopular opinions. I had a relationship with the professor from FSY and felt comfortable being myself because she knew that I was not being malicious and that my feelings were valid. This gave me the courage to express my opinions fully. In other sections, I was the quiet freshman, intimidated by the upperclassmen who had the confidence to appear much smarter then they were. Sections are also hard when you feel like you connect to text in different ways than most people do. When I would talk in section, I felt like everyone was giving me weird looks because they couldn’t identify with my experience or appreciate its intellectual value. Even when I was in predominately white spaces with one other Black student, there wasn’t often the opportunity to connect because the whiteness of the room and the topic of discussion was stifling. These moments were often the times that I felt the most alienated at Yale. The first semester of my sophomore year, I took an African American Studies course that met at the Af Am House. For the first time I felt connected to the House as I saw so many beautiful Black faces smiling back at me, ready to learn about our collective and separate identities in a social and academic space. This class was one of the most beautiful experiences that I had at Yale. The beauty in the class was that there wasn’t a monolithic experience of Blackness. We had first generation Americans, students from the Continent, descendants of slaves, people from the islands and so much more. The class was also challenging in some aspects, because it highlighted the economic differences between me and some of my Black peers who had gone to private school. There were sometimes classist undertones in the ways that they interpreted Black text that was hard to reconcile with my experience of growing up in a low income urban environment. Despite this, we were still in a predominately Black space where it felt safe to explore our differences. We weren’t fighting against the oppressive white male presence that I experienced in some of my other seminars. Being in an academic setting with people who looked like me was an addicting classroom experience, and I crave to go back to last semester just to be in that space. A mostly Black academic environment is a rare occurrence because Yale’s academic system has historically put more value on white male voices, both in the learning environment and in the texts we engage with. Low income, first generation, students of color will continue to feel silenced. Programs like FSY are helpful for community building, but nothing will change the fact that the “traditional” Yale student will have the upper hand in a small classroom environment. In order to push back against 315 years of the traditional Yale classroom discussion, we need to restructure the conversation to value all of the voices present.        by Joseph Zordan and Alejandra Padín-Dujon On April 28th, Battell Chapel filled with students of color for the second time this academic year since November’s “A Moment of Crisis: Race at Yale Teach-In.” The assembly came in the wake of President Salovey’s April 27th email informing the student body that after “extensive consultation involving students, faculty, alumni, administrators, and the fellows of the Yale Corporation,” the new colleges would be named for Anna Pauline “Pauli” Murray (’65 J.S.D., ’79 Hon. D. Div.)—a queer Black female civil rights activist—and Benjamin Franklin, the personal idol of Yale College alum Charles B. Johnson ’54, who donated $250 million towards the construction of the new residential colleges in 2013. Salovey also announced that “head of college” would replace the title of residential college “master.” The administration declined to rename Calhoun College. Secretary and Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews followed President Salovey’s email with a campus-wide invitation to “continued discussion” at Battell Chapel the following afternoon. Students frustrated with the Calhoun verdict and the decision to name a new residential college after Benjamin Franklin—a white male slaveowner who did not attend Yale University—mobilized overnight. At President Salovey’s first word, activists tossed fake paper money. The shower of currency was repeated at Salovey’s first mention of Benjamin Franklin College, and at his final word. With every flurry, student activists seated in the front row held up Monopoly boards bearing the message “Yale is a Monopoly.” Explained student organizer Katie McCleary ’18, president of the Association of Native Americans at Yale, “We rained money down on Salovey because we know what matters to him and his administration.” Many students wore T-shirts distributed by the Women’s Center bearing soul singer Aretha Franklin’s image and captioned “Franklin College/We Deserve R-E-S-P-E-C-T.” Franklin received an honorary degree from the University in 2010. Others covered their mouths with duct tape to protest the administration’s disregard of student input on the college naming decisions. Noted Ellie Pritchett ’19, co-organizer of April’s Queer Feminist Voices Open Mic at the Afro-American Cultural Center, “Weve been through this a thousand times and we arent stupid […] we have no more emotional labor to expend.” Once President Salovey ended opened the floor for commentary, a succession of speakers critiqued the premise that the decision to retain the name of Calhoun College had any moral or educational value. Objected one student, “So my fellow students’ pain is an educational experience?” “Yale does not have the resources to carry out this conversation. We are hemorrhaging faculty of color,” added Julianna Simms ’18. The demonstration ended when student organizer Ivetty Estepan ’18 spoke the words, “I have some closing remarks” into a microphone, signaling students to send out one last flurry of paper money. Demonstrators then exited the chapel singing “We Don’t Mind,” an anthem from the protests of last semester. Several stayed behind to clean the chapel floors of paper money in order to avoid burdening the janitorial staff. Concluded student organizer Eli Ceballo-Countryman ’18, “Yale certainly made the wrong move this time.” Social media posts about the demonstration can be identified by the hashtag #WrongMoveYale. Photo by Alex Zhang         by Miguel Paredes  “Acuérdate de siempre dar gracias” Remember to always give thanks. These are the words I grew up hearing from my mother reminding me that every step I take is only made possible by the countless people supporting me upright. In times of anger and sadness, I often forget to give thanks.  Thus, I want to take a moment to do so now.  Thank you to the beautiful POC community on this campus. Thank you for sharing with me your tears and  your infectious laughter and hope. Thank you for taking my hand as I sang alongside you all and for telling me that my voice, as off-key as it may be, is worth being heard  loud and proud.  Thank you for supporting me as my walls crumbled. Thank you for teaching me how to rebuild them, brick by brick, with a door that’s always open to you all. Thank you for raising your fists when mine were trembling in fear.  Thank you to the faculty of color on campus. You taught us the history behind our scars and how our stitching is not a point of weakness but a symbol of our strength. Thank you for the countless hours you’ve spent mentoring us, pushing us to grow not only as academics but also as people worthy of repainting the white pages of our histories with vibrant colors. Thank you for showing us that we are loved.  My gratitude is not free nor easily given; it is earned. However, many claim to deserve it. Last week at Battell Chapel, President Salovey demanded that I give thanks to the Yale Corporation and to the donors who fund my financial aid package. A financial aid package that Yale falsely advertises as “loan-free.”  While I am thankful for the opportunity that my parents never even dreamed of, my financial aid has certainly not been without great cost. It is filled with loans. Loans that I have had to repay in full. With interest. With sweat, tears, and sleepless nights. Ive paid with every dollar towards my student contribution and not to my family, every word I uttered in an attempt to carve my narrative into these white walls, every tear I shed and every tear I have wiped away from my friends’ face, every essay poorly written or pset unfinished because of the time I have spent consoling, crying, organizing. With every educational opportunity I have missed, I have repaid my loans in full.  Yale, I have given you my gratitude in the palms of my tired hands and you have turned it cold – cold like the money you say is worth more than my words.  My grandfather’s hands were calloused from cultivating the fields of Zarzal, Colombia.  My father’s hands are calloused from the weight of carrying my mother and me across an ocean and rebuilding our life anew in this country.  My hands will soon be calloused from the labor of trying to make this university listen to not only the screams but the hopeful songs of my friends and my family.  So thank you Yale for giving me a community that has stitched my heart every single time you have broke it. For giving me a glimpse of the world I constantly dream of; one that that is beautiful and full of color.   photo by Alex Zhang         by Matt Thekkethala On the afternoon of Friday April 29th, 2016, I celebrated my first Holi. I ventured to the Swing Space courtyard with a group of friends decked out in white t-shirts and sunglasses, joyfully threw colored powder at said group in addition to many other strangers, took several photos with said group in order to post them on Facebook to prove to my high school friends that I was having fun in college and actually had friends, ate a few samosas, and returned to my residential college. I’ll admit something. I was not motivated by a desire to appreciate Indian culture, or to get more involved in the South Asian community on campus. I was motivated mostly – if not entirely – by the opportunity to take vibrant photographs of me and my friends covered from head to toe in colored powder just so I could update my cover photo. The sad part of this story is that the photographs did not come out too well; I was forced to put them through Instagram filters in order to make them Facebook-ready. The sadder part of this story is that I’m Indian. My first instinct when reflecting on this experience was to believe that Holi had become a victim of cultural appropriation. And yes, though I did contribute to that appropriation by exploiting this event for my own sociopathic social media intentions, I’ll give myself credit for being able to step back and look at the bigger picture. Holi, a Hindu festival signifying both the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil, was appropriated, co-opted, and reduced to “Color Runs,” electronic music festivals, and a study break for privileged college students – myself included – to appear happy, fun-loving, and cultured. As I said before, this was my first Holi. This is not because I’m some kind of whitewashed, Americanized Indian who has rejected Indian culture. Quite the contrary. My family is Catholic. Holi is a Hindu festival. Thus, it was never important to my idea of being Indian. Then again, neither was Christmas. I now see many similarities between Christmas and Holi. We’ve forgotten “the true meaning” of both of them. I am the Ebenezer Scrooge, the Grinch, and the Charlie Brown of Holi. I am frustrated with the commercialization and subsequent fetishization of what was once a sacred celebration. I find no mention of ‘Holi’ or ‘India’ on The Color Run’s website. No one I spoke to at Yale’s celebration of Holi – myself included – had any idea about what the significance of the festival was, yet everyone exploited it for social media. We forgot the true meaning of Holi, and I am part of the problem. When the Hindu deity Krishna was a baby, he was poisoned by a demon’s breast milk and as a result, his skin turned blue forever. Growing up, he worried that girls would not like him because of his skin color. His mother encouraged him to approach the lovely goddess Radha, and to color her face any way he’d like to. Krishna does exactly this, and Radha falls in love with him. Holi is a commemoration of this myth; people rejoice in the love of Krishna and Radha around the world on this day, in addition to celebrating the arrival of spring, having fun with friends and loved ones, and forgiving past wrongdoings and moving on. This is the true meaning of Holi, generally speaking. As I complain about Holi’s misappropriation to my suitemate, he laughs. “Why does every guy that throws colored powder at someone have to give credit to the Indians?” He has a point. What constitutes cultural appropriation? How do we prevent it? Should cultures copyright their customs and holidays so that they’re never appropriated? Will these customs and holidays remain copyrighted for 70-80 years until they’re released into the public domain so that they may be appropriated then? I’ve gone too far now, haven’t I? I don’t mean to invalidate other instances of cultural appropriation. I’ve been told time and time again that ‘White America’ has appropriated and co-opted Black American culture time and time again, and I believe it. But is Holi appropriated? When I think of cultural appropriation, I think of the swastika. Hitler took a symbol which originally signified “good fortune” and “wellbeing” in the Hindu faith, and twisted it. Literally. He rotated it 45 degrees. But he also twisted its meaning so that it symbolized the bigoted notion of a ‘master Aryan race.’ To me, cultural appropriation is using an idea or image from a minority culture for a purpose it was not originally intended. Color Runs and electronic music festivals, when you really get down to it, are all about channeling upbeat, optimistic energy. Just like Holi. The social media aspect of college-organized Holi events isn’t necessarily appropriation either. We throw colored powder and post photos of ourselves throwing colored powder for the same reason: to share our happiness and positive spirit. So, no. As far as I know, Holi isn’t appropriated. That’s not to say that I don’t think something should change. I think celebrations of Holi, especially those that include non-Hindus, should be prefaced by some kind of explanation of the background and significance of this festival. I’m not exactly sure what “appreciation of a culture” looks like, but I think my suggestion is a step in the right direction. And when we post pictures of ourselves throwing colored powder at each other, we won’t just be privileged college students who appear happy, fun-loving, and cultured. We’ll be privileged college students who appear happy and fun-loving, and are actually a bit more cultured than we used to be.        by Ashia Ajani  Trigger warning: sexual assault, rape I am on the Yale shuttle. I’m scrolling through Facebook aimlessly, when a video my friend shared catches my eye. The title is “See the College Acceptance Letter That’s Shocking High School Seniors”. Nothing more, nothing less. It is decision season, so I’m intrigued. I open the video to see tearful high schoolers elated that they got into the college of their dreams. A crying girl reads the acceptance letter out loud: “be prepared for a challenging year ahead that will include losing your virginity to a rapist.”  For a few moments, I can’t breathe. My face feels numb. I count down from ten four separate times. I do this more often than I’d care to admit. I’ve just saved myself from an anxiety attack with time to spare before I have to be alert and ready to participate in section.  This video was inspired by a letter entitled “The Unacceptable Acceptance Letter” printed in The Harvard Crimson by two companies, an advertising agency and a production company respectively, whose creative teams thought it would “be an authentic way to expose the dark truth that so many colleges hide.”  In this case, I have to wonder if authentic became synonymous with violent to these companies. As active participants in the broader “Don’t Rape” campaign, it is interesting and rather frightening to see the dynamic shift from attacker to victim. Is this a greater call for awareness, or just a way to scare and emotionally scar students? It’s hard for me to believe that my response to the video was unique.  For survivors of sexual assault, this video can be a painful reminder of events that transpired.There is no tact in the presentation of the video, and the students’ reactions are horrifying to watch.  The creative team, Petruccelli and Cooke, says that they don’t want to scare students, just “arm them with facts that will keep them safe.” Then why are students reading phrases like “violently raped in a basement,” “third victim,” and telling young children that “they’re next” once the letter is completed?  Sexual assault on college campuses is endemic. The statistics from the Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct are shocking and telling of how survivors don’t trust their universities to take cases of sexual assault seriously.  However, I don’t think a video of people who aren’t explicitly stated as survivors of sexual assault does anything more than terrify incoming freshman, invalidate the work that survivors are conducting on their respective campuses, and uses the stories of survivors at the survivors’ expense.  Perhaps I’m just sensitive. The creative team does plan to feature stories of actual survivors….in the future of the campaign. Their hearts are in the right place (I can only assume). But something still throws me off. There isn’t even a trigger warning attached to the article or the video.
